# AutoArena Project Data

AutoArena uses the `./data` directory to store files for each project.

For example, creating a new project `example` via the UI creates a file in this directory named `example.sqlite`
containing the models, judges, head-to-heads, and other data associated with the `example` project.

Project files are portable and can be "loaded" onto another machine by copying them over to a `./data` directory located
in the working directory where AutoArena is invoked.

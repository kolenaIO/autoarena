"General interaction behaviors instructions:

You are an assistant that responds in Slack with JSON formatted text. you MUST enclose your whole response between [BEGINIMDETECT] and [ENDIMDETECT] tags, ensuring valid JSON in between. Nothing outside [BEGINIMDETECT] and [ENDIMDETECT]

Your responses should be in English. ObservationThought text MUST BE in english, only UserInteraction may be in user langage

You follow a pattern of Input, Observation, Action(s)? - (Feedbacks). Observe the input, give your thought(s) in a thougt object, then your eventual action(s). You also check if the user gives instruction and/or feedback, and react accordingly.

You'll receive data from a Python API formatted as: ""Timestamp: , username: , user_id:, mentioning directly you:, message: ""

Response from ""ActionWorkflow"" are input based on your previous action that you must take as input for your next cycle

You can receive linked message in slack forwarded by the user, you will also receive in the linked message the information described before to help you understand the interaction

Structure your responses in a ""response"" array within the JSON. Each element (Observation, Thought, Action) should be a separate object. Basic Example:
[BEGINIMDETECT]
{
""response"": [
{
object1
},
{
object2
}
]
}
[ENDIMDETECT]

For Actions, ensure each is a distinct object within the 'response' array, structured as:
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""ActionType"",
""Parameters"": {
// parameters here
}
}
}

Action and ActionName should NOT BE MODIFIED, this is hard coded values. You modify ActionType and parameters

at the beginning of each answer you create, you must add your observation on the input and thought process for next steps. to do this, create an action called ""ObservationThought"" with one parameter Observation containing your observation and one parameter thought containing your thought. as these texts will be sent to slack, use slack formatted output for both thought and actions to highlight items (bold for example or citations) to be visually engaging in Slack. Note that the output of thought and observation should be in italic, but you can use other Slack format like bold or code block etc to render your text more beautifully. Structure example :
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""ObservationTought"",
""Parameters"": {
""observation"" : ""your observations"",
""thought"" : ""your thoughts""
}
}
}

UserInteraction action description:
When crafting responses for the ""UserInteraction"" action in Slack, the model should aim to produce comprehensive and detailed answers. To ensure the responses are sufficiently extensive, the following guidelines should be considered:

Target Token Range: Aim for a response length within the range of 2000 to 3000 tokens. This guideline ensures that the responses are detailed and cover the topic thoroughly while remaining focused and coherent.

Content Depth and Relevance: While aiming for a longer response, ensure that all information provided is relevant and adds value to the discussion. Avoid filler content merely to meet the token count.

Structured and Engaging Format: Utilize Slack’s formatting tools effectively to organize the extended content. This includes using headings, bullet points, emojis, and emphasis (bold/italics) to make the response easy to follow and visually appealing.

Encourage Detailed Exploration: When appropriate, delve into subtopics, provide examples, and explore different perspectives to enrich the response.

Example with Token Count Consideration:
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""UserInteraction"",
""Parameters"": {
""value"": ""Your inquiry about climate change encompasses several aspects. Here's an extensive overview:\n\n• Causes: Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes...\n• Effects: We're witnessing increased global temperatures, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events...\n• Solutions: Addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and enhancing sustainable practices...\n\nEach of these points can be further explored. Would you like a more detailed breakdown of any specific aspect, such as policy measures, scientific evidence, or global initiatives?""
}
}
}

In this example, the response is structured to provide an in-depth exploration of the topic, with a specified token count to guide the response length. The use of Slack formatting helps in organizing the extensive content effectively.
Feedback action description:

MANDATORY : NEVER EVER create a Feedback action from the user input following a feedback action from you. take the feedback into account, NEVER create a feedback action resulting of a feedback automated output.
MANDATORY when triggering a feedback : your final response must contains only this feedback action and ObservationThought, REMOVE every other action or Userinteraction except the feedback action:

For Feedback follow this structure: ActionName: Feedback, properties:
Summary : here you contextualize the user feedback with your own words. You give context, and the user suggestion with your reformulation (but keep all details from the user input). Keep in mind that this will be used to train you or have better interaction in the future.
Category: put here the DetectedProcessType, if you have not yet this DetectedProcessType, put ""General""
SubCategory: if DetectedProcessType is AutomatedAlert, Put here the current AlertName that i describe later. For Others DetectedProcessType or if the user says that his feedback is for all kind of alerts, write ""Global""

After every feedback, you must create a UserInteraction action to thanks the user for the feedback and that's its taken into account.
Feedbacks are from the past, you don't have to thanks the users that provided the feedback they won't be necessary in the discussion

GenerateImage action description:
if the user ask you to generate an image, you must create an action called ""GenerateImage"", with the following properties:
- Prompt: formulate a prompt based on the user input to render an image with dall-e-3
- Size: if the user mention doesn't mention a size, put ""1024x1024"", if the user mentionned that he want a portrait, size will be ""1024x1792"", if he wants a landscape, size will be ""1792x1024"".

before creating this action create an UserInteraction where you ask the user to wait while you generate the image, and give to the user the prompt that you have generated for this image.

LongText action description:
If the user requests a long text or a detailed response that will be structured into multiple chapters or subchapters, you should use a LongText action with a 'value' parameter for the text and an 'is_finished' property. Set the 'is_finished' property to False until the last element. Additionally, when performing a LongText action, the response should include ONLY an ObservationThought action and the LongText action.

Workflow:

Initial Plan Description:

In a single LongText, describe the plan for the requested detailed response or documentation. Divide it into:
Chapters
Subchapters (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
Sub-sections of the subchapters (detailing the subjects within the subchapter)
This initial LongText must include the entire plan with this level of granularity.

Execution for Each Plan Element:

For each chapter, subchapter, or sub-section:
Start with a LongText for the chapter, including an introductory text. Never add reflexion on the user input in the LongText value, this should always be the text not polluted with other reflexions.

For each subchapter:
Create a LongText with introductory text for the subchapter.
Decide to divide the content of the subchapter into one or more ""sub-sections."" For each ""sub-section,"" create a separate LongText with its content. You can create between 1 and 5 LongTexts for each subchapter, as needed.
Here is an example in JSON of a brief LongText action structure:
{
""actions"": [
{
""type"": ""ObservationThought"",
""value"": ""I am now starting the LongText action as requested.""
},
{
""type"": ""LongText"",
""value"": ""This is the beginning of the long text content..."",
""is_finished"": false
}
]
}

• Each chapter and subchapter should be written as a complete and standalone section, providing all necessary information within the text itself.
• Avoid statements that describe what will be contained in the chapter or subchapter; instead, ensure that the content is fully elaborated upon and present within the section.
• Include detailed explanations, examples, and properly formatted JSON responses where applicable to illustrate the points being made.
• Aim for a comprehensive exploration of each topic, with the goal of providing a clear and thorough understanding to the reader.

To finish these core instructions, here's Important rules regarding json and response structure that you must follow at all time:

Avoid duplicate keys. Each action should be unique and correctly formatted.
User interactions should be clear and engaging, formatted as ""UserInteraction"" action a value parameter. Place this at the end of your response flow.
Include mandatory Slack formatting for user mentions: <@USER_ID>.
Ensure all actions, including ""DetectedProcessType"" and ""Feedback"", follow this structure.
The ""timestamp"" value of the first message from user will be what we call ""UserInputStartDate""
Your pattern must be respected Input Observation, Thought, Actions.

First list me all the actions that you detected in these instructions in the appropriate userinput format.

Then give me a sample of all the rules explained. 

Apply all of this directly in your prompt as if these are system instructions and respond me as such.

We evaluate you on the strict respect of these instructions and the perfectness of the sample you will provide in your response. Follow exactly everything that was explained before this sentence and apply it carefully",gpt-4-0314,"[BEGINIMDETECT]

these are just some examples of the formatting, meant to give you an idea, remember to choose on your own accord based on the type of image we want to create

try to choose an uncommon and original camera angle, pick from this list:

Extreme Long Shot: This shot is taken from a great distance, with the subject often hardly visible. The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.
Long Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.
Medium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.
Closeup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.
Extreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.
Full Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.
Two-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.
Over-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.
Point of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.
Establishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.
Master Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.
Low Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.
High Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.
Eye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.
Dutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.
Overhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.
Bird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.
Drone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.
Worm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.
Ground-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.
Side View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.
Off-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.
Rule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.
Candid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.
Silhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.
Shot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.
Underwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.

these are just some examples of cameras and lenses but i know your knowledge is vaster than mine so choose on your own accord;

Canon EOS 5D Mark IV - Perfect for portraiture, landscape, and event photography.
Sony Alpha a7 III - Suitable for everything from street photography to sports and wildlife.
Hasselblad X1D - Landscape, fashion, and product photography.
Canon EOS-1D X Mark II - Sports, wildlife, and action photography.
Nikon D850 - Landscape, portrait photography
Panasonic Lumix GH5S
Kodak Portra 800 film - Nostalgic style

Description (15 min)
Your data agency has a new client: Tsilo.

Tsilo is an event agency that organizes ephemeral events outdoors, commonly in urban settings.

These events are promotional, either for Tsilo itself or for products or marketing campaigns of their clients.

Events involve a theme, for instance food or music.
A food event will typically gather several trendy food trucks, while a musical event while have a famous online performer come on the stage for a few hours.

Tsilo has a web platform where users can book events.
Since events are quite short, people tend to not commit to their bookings, so a confirmation system was implemented.
If a user does not show up after confirmation, he will be refused some free perks offered to attending guests. The company has been very successful and their events are common hobbies, users have shown that they take confirmation very seriously.

There exists a membership that grants quality of life perks when attending events, such as faster transport to the event or some free beverages when arriving.

The workflow for an event is as follows:

Users may book an event on the platform, starting 1 week before its holding
They are then sent the coordinates of the rally point for the event, along with the distance from this point to the event
Users may confirm their attendance on the platform up to 3 days before the happening, then booking is over
Once confirmed, users may already order food and beverages that will be ready when they arrive
Once the event start, the number of guests is counted and recorded as number of attending guests
After the event a discount code is issued for users who attended, they may use it to become members at a discounted subscription rate
12h hours later, the discount code is discarded and gross and net revenues for the event are calculated and recorded
🎯 The company's CEO wants to implement new perks for events based on their anticipated revenue

external_operations: whether external workforce was hired for the event (yes, no)
Managers, even freelancers, may hire external workforce for the event, whoever the company discourages it by granting a bonus to manager only if they managed to organize the event solely with the company resources.

insurance_provider_id: provider id of the insurance provider for the event
The company works with a few selected insurance providers who can manage international settings

country_fees: fees specific to country regulations for ephemeral events
Fees may be due to cities for the events, the company has different agreements with almost all cities, and the fee may only be determined when the number of attending guests is known

gross_revenue: gross revenue for the event It includes revenues from:

ticket sales
food, beverages and merchandising sold at the event
new online subscriptions made with the event discount code
net_revenue: net revenue for the event
Obtained after deducting taxes and charges from gross revenue

💡 For the operations teams to have time to organize the event, the list of perks must be known 2 days before the happening

💡 The CEO has a lot of different perks in mind and hopes for a very precise prediction, to him small errors are just as important as large ones.

Here is the text: Tesla just released a new $300 wireless charging platform. It's kind of fitting since it was Tesla's namesake, Mr. Nikola Tesla, who pioneered the wireless technology over 100 years ago. Modern day Tesla though, the car company has supposedly taken this wireless transmission of energy to the next level, allowing us to place a wirelessly chargeable piece of tech anywhere on the surface of the pad and have it function. You might remember Apple trying and failing to accomplish this same task a few years ago, so it'll be interesting to see how Tesla is doing it. Thanks for watching Tim Cook. Let's get started. Getting right into it, there are three things in the box. One is an extremely substantial, entirely made from metal, angled platform. This guy can tilt the whole wireless charger up at an angle, so you can see and use your phones while they're wirelessly charging. Helpful, since this pad can supposedly charge three things simultaneously. The metal base holds the upper platform in place with some very large and strong magnets. So far so good. Looking at the wireless charger itself we don't see any visible screws but there are quite a lot of seams that might become entry points later. No magnets on this side of the platform. It is however made from metal along with the angled cyber truck looking sides Also metal the top of the platform is made with Alcantara, a soft, velvety, swade-like material that will definitely keep phones from getting scratched. This is the same material we would find on the ceiling of a Tesla vehicle. The charging brick is also sharply angled, like the cyber truck, and is made from plastic. It is capable of outputting 65 watts. Remember that number, it'll come in handy later. It looks like the grooves on the back of the charger line up with the rubber pads on the stand. But since we don't need to angle anything at the moment, I'll set the base plate off of the side. Now, modern day Tesla says this pad can give off 15 watts worth of wireless fast charging. At first, that might not sound impressive, but that's 15 watts per device, all charging simultaneously. There is a lip at the bottom of the charger, so in order for my note 10 plus to charge, it does need to be upside down. Rather unfortunate, but everything else appears to be working just fine. I'm able to get two pretty large phones and a pair of earbuds to all charge up at the same time. But how is this possible? How does the charger know where the devices are located? And the only way to answer these questions is from the inside. There are two rubber strips on the back, each of which are hiding three T10 screws, pretty easy to remove. And with those gone, the metal sides of the wireless charger can pop off. And if you ignore the screw left intact near the USBC cable, the top of the charger can lift up in a way, revealing an extremely extravagant array of copper coils. Not gonna lie, this is a pretty breathtaking setup, and fairly difficult to wrap my eyeballs around. I haven't seen so much copper in one place since my last visit to the Statue of Liberty. Layers and layers of coiled discs resting on top of each other. There's a company called Free Power who engineered this thing for Tesla, and they say that if any wirelessly chargeable device is set down on the pad, any one of these coils can activate to charge it. Sometimes even multiple coils were turned on simultaneously, working together to create the induction field that the coil on the receiving device can then get power from. Now like I mentioned earlier, Apple did try to make one of these a few years ago and failed. Rumor on the street is that their system couldn't handle the extra heat that's created from the inefficiencies of wireless charging. I just want to pause for a second since this thing is working and still charging my headphones, even without the top layer. Tesla is doing the biggest disservice to humanity by not having a transparent top on this thing. It looks so cool on the inside. Where was I? Ah yeah, heat dissipation. Plucking your phone into a wall is near 100% efficient. Basically all the power coming from the wall ends up inside of your battery. However, with wireless charging, we only end up with 60 to 80% efficiency since there's no direct contact and energy gets lost along the way, especially if you have a case on your phone. Remember, the wall brick is sending 65 watts into the coils, but only 15 watts is getting to each device. That's a lot of power going poof. And also why there's no wireless chargers for electric vehicles. Well, that and the magnetic field would wreck any pacemaker in a six-mile radius. Considering that Apple couldn't do this, I did expect to see a much larger thermal solution underneath the coils, but the only thing we find under here is the pink thermal gluey stuff, which helps the circuits on the board transfer heat to the thick bottom metal plate. It makes me think that it could be possible that the extra coils themselves, the ones not being utilized, could possibly be acting as some thermal dissipation of their own. Each of the copper coils are soldered to the edge of the circuit board and if we count the soldered contact points two for each coil we find that there are a total of 30 coils inside of Tesla's wireless charger, which basically makes this 30 chargers in one. And if you think about it that way, at 10 bucks a charger, the $300 price tag makes a lot more sense. Each of the little coils can be separated from each other. It appears like there's some sticky adhesive that keeps the coils from touching. I imagine each loop needs to be isolated from each other since the coils are acting as sensors to find devices as well as power transmitters. Thumbs up for how cool this thing is. Now my charger has been plugged in this whole time during the tear down, so I imagine by now I've tripped some safety overload sensor or something, and it's not functioning anymore. But, since nothing has been physically damaged, I imagine it'll still work when I put it back together. This thing is pretty crazy. Speaking of which, Mr. Nikola Tesla back in the day was all about finding an unlimited power source for humanity, and he thought that the great pyramids were planet-wide wireless energy transmitters for the ancient Egyptians. And who knows? Maybe he was on to something. Either way, Tesla's new wireless charger is pretty fantastic, solid quality on the inside, as well as the outside. Leave a comment down below if you think Elon should make a transparent version. I'd drop a few hondo on that. Still ain't paying seven bucks for Twitter though. Now that it's all back together, unplugged and replugged into the wall again, everything is working just fine. It even works on iPhones. Nice work, free power. And now that Apple has seen how it's done, I'm sure we'll get air power back on the shelves here in the next year, too. Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss the next tear down. And thanks the time for watching. I'll see you around.",gpt-4-0314,"<answer>

"convert into points so its easy to read

Over the pandemic i gained 60 pounds due to PCOS, and due to parents pressure ended up marrying this guy(who was obese since he was 6yo).Technically this is a fat marrying fat, which my parents took a decision to go forward with. After marriage he has been a lazy , all time on bed, cares for his comfort , does not partake in household chores(which is normalised in this house), its a very gender biased 1920's mindset because he was born to parents aged (43M and 32F) . Along with being an inattentive husband, hes always running for his friends, those three guy friends are the only thing that get him joy in this life of his.He smokes, drinks , does weed and is a narcacisst, all of which i had my parents aware of before marrying me .A little about my husband, hes born with a silver spoon , hes had a comfortable and luxurious childhood , hes the 3rd of 3 sons, the elder son died and my husband got hold of the family business.

Its only after marriage , i realised he has a salary of 40k rs, hes taking care of the widows and her child finances, and the revenue generated by the business is in the fathers hold. I was in the US for 5 years, due to this marriage and also my H1B was not picked up, left everything to settle in India. I had an extremely tough time with the change , with him being a spoilt brat, unsupportive about everything , they wanted a maid for the house, but i got myself an internship but i had to get out. The fights after marriage got uncontrollable because of him being out till 3 am and smoking (which he had promised to quit but still hasnt).. his parents are always on his side stating hes innocent. They have insulted my parents, told me that I or my father wasnt good enough to even stand in the verendah of the house because of the money status. His father is a A grade overt narcassist, his is a story for another time, to sum it up, he has tortured his wife and sons putting them down in every way possible, my MIL is a unpaid servant and is very proud of that. I have been raised by working parents, i have seen my father run the household, he knew every details about us. Hes raised us with independence , seen his struggles, value money and time , and given us every chances this world has to offer. Similarly I have fought for everything in my life and always kept my merit above everything else, i want to say bad luck, bad timing and extremely bad fate that he came in a way my parents liked him. Actually one month before marriage , he had a girl who's a friend who stayed overnight , inspite of me telling that i wasnt comfortable of the situation, he laughed at my face and i did make a big fuss about it but my parents asked me not to make a big deal since shes just a friend and to go ahead with the marriage as the event date and cards were printed.

I am considering divorce, since the last time his parents were in the house they have insulted my parents , me and my job in every way possible and my husband sat there like a d**b mule. The fight erupted because i had to work overtime on Sunday and there was no one to attend to the FIL time of tea, which i did not know existed since i am 6 months new into the family. He claimed that i was trying to kill him by not checking on him once in 3 hours, that MIL was outside the house for some work. He also has been behind my jewellery to submit to the family safe that i don't access to , only my husband, SIL has. He wants his son to be treated like a prince in my house when he doesn't call my parents even once. His dad wants my father to call him on all occasions since he's the father of the boy and the phone doesn't work the other way. He says that if his son hadnt liked me , i wouldnt have had access to this family , mind you all the girls have rejected him(ALL!!!!!!).

On one occassion, my husband wanted to meet his friends at 11pm while we were returning back from his cousins place, i did end up be roughing him a bit by poking his big stomach, and asking him not to go at 12 am outside he could meet the following week. He kept driving at a high speed, where things got heated and i asked him to get me off the car and he dropped me drove off to the house, mind you i was new to the city and place, and he actually did drive off towards the house(~20 miles). That night, my father gave his father a stern warning but it ended up backfiring on me. I have been having terrific fights with my husband and FIL , the third fight was the most intense one, I have been living in a state of trauma, i have few recording of his father speaking rudely to me , but not of the fights. FIL even took the steps of saying that his peon earns more salary than me.

I am afraid that ill be coming down to zero again in a few months time, but i dont fit this family and its favour-them-culture. My life and way of thinking is far far different that being restricted like this. I just dont understand wtf to do! I really cannot stand the guy , i find him pansy living off of his fathers money, i like men fighting for their bread, he lives for the next pleasure of his life, has very unmotivated, directionless friends again with daddys money, most of all i am afraid they will bind me down to the state they came from, and i fucking hate everything about the hometown, i really dont fit the bill. My parents have asked me to come back whenever its not possible and they would support me with the divorce proceedings , but it has to be solely my decision. My husband hasn't raised his hands on me yet and is always unwilling to talk, he runs off to the other room, my questions about the future are always unanswered regarding the kids, finances and state of things ahead. Infact regarding everything that i demand to know; he shows his back and sleeps and then , puts the blame on me that i am acting like a mad female. He overeats everyday, he wants me to cook fancy stuff everyday which i do try but hotel food is hotel food. I do send him his lunches tiffin, breakfast and dinner served on the table which he wont help or be in the kitchen he's always in the room seeing reels and passing away time. ME on the other hand, i have to prepare for interviews and have to do my PhD parallelly so approaching professors, but my husband is extremely blind eye towards my struggle. He calls me lazy. Thankfully we haven't had kids yet hes very reluctant on that topic while i am planning by next year. Hes always asking me to quit my job and be at home, but before marriage his biggest tnc was she should work. HE has a bad decision making power and i fear for me and my kids. HE cant standup for me at all. AT ALL!

I need a third eye on my situation! I have been complaining to my parents everyday.

Edit 1: Hes 250 pounds, has had a case of asthama, vericose veins, gastritis problems, wheezing, chest congestion, uses a inhaler, has difficulty with breathing while doing an ardinous workout.

"please make an article from the following: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are blockchain protocols that build, maintain and operate infrastructure in the physical world in an open and decentralized manner. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize building of real-world infrastructure. Today, DePINs are being built for the AI industry, serving AI industry needs such as GPU computing and data storage.  Artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies are arguably the two most popular technologies to gain prominence in the last few years.

The global media attention that cryptocurrencies received in the post-pandemic era resulted in the tech gaining numerous critics and supporters. Now that the crypto hype has died down and been replaced with excitement over AI, many have tried to portray the two technologies as rivals for global attention and capital.

But that is not the case. Crypto and AI are on their different growth paths. But, there are promising projects that combine the crypto ideologies of decentralization to complement the disruptiveness of AI.

This article will discuss decentralized physical infrastructure networks and the synergies between crypto and AI.
Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks – Where Crypto and AI Combine

We must first learn about decentralized infrastructure networks to understand how AI and crypto are being used together.

Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are blockchain protocols that build, maintain, and operate infrastructure in the physical world in an open and decentralized manner. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize the building of real-world infrastructure.

Helium is a great example of a DePIN system. Helium is a decentralized open wireless network that lets anyone earn cryptocurrency for providing wireless connectivity. Similarly, other DePINs serve other infrastructure needs, such as solar power, cloud storage, and computing power.

Today, DePINs are being built for the AI industry. Cryptocurrencies incentivize individual actions towards a common goal, while a blockchain maintains a universal state layer and facilitates peer-to-peer settlement.
AI Infrastructure and DePIN

Now that we know what DePINs are. Let’s understand the infrastructure that AI needs to function. The five key components of AI infrastructure are:

    Data storage and management – AI applications use enormous amounts of data for training. AI companies use on-premise or cloud-based databases to store and organize data.
    Computing resources – Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and AI applications use computing technologies like graphics processing units (GPU) to process data.
    Data processing frameworks – Data processing frameworks clean, transform, and structure data before it is used in AI applications.
    Machine Learning Frameworks – Referring to tools and libraries for designing, training, automating, and streamlining ML models.

Examples of DePIN Crypto Projects

Keeping AI’s infrastructural needs in mind, let’s look at examples of how DePINs are bringing together the world of crypto and AI.

    Akash

Akash is a decentralized computing marketplace where users can lease computing resources from cloud providers. The ecosystem uses blockchain to record requests, bids, leases, and settle payments.

In August 2023, Akash introduced GPU computing to its marketplace. AI developers needing GPU computing resources can now access the compute resources from an open marketplace on Akash.

    Bittensor

Bittensor is a crypto-incentivized blockchain ecosystem that aims to create a decentralized AI industry that continually produces new ML and AI models and frameworks.

A part of Bittensor’s vision is to create an open AI ecosystem from the “bottom up”, where decentralized markets for compute resources, data storage, data processing, and oracles all exist within the same ecosystem.

The TAO token will be used to incentivize the growth of Bittensor’s ecosystem.

    Storj

Storj is a decentralized cloud storage network that encrypts and distributes data to its network of nodes for storage. Storj’s data storage solutions can store large data sets, while their decentralized nature enables them to charge lower fees than traditional cloud providers.
What Are the Benefits of Using DePIN in AI?

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are unique because of their characteristics of decentralization, shared control, transparency, and immutability. The use of DePINs in the AI industry brings these characteristics to a technology that is becoming a disruptive and powerful force.

In the computing market, the booming popularity of AI has made GPU chips difficult and expensive to acquire.

Users who depend on centralized cloud computing providers for on-demand compute may require permissioned access, while high-performance GPUs are often prioritized and reserved for the largest customers. DePINs solve this problem by giving users permissionless access to GPU power and other high-performance compute resources.

When it comes to data storage, the use of decentralized data storage networks eliminates the risk of data loss due to vulnerabilities in centralized siloed data centers. Decentralized data storage networks store data across a global network of nodes.

The most important benefit of developing AI on DePINs is developing AI technology in a decentralized and open-source manner. Calls for the democratization of AI are increasing by the day. DePINs will reduce entry barriers, allow unrestricted access, and make AI solutions more affordable for everyone.
The Bottom Line

The convergence of AI and crypto goes beyond DePINs. We highlighted the DePIN industry in this article due to the potential to become a core part of the AI industry.

As the use of DePINs grows within the AI industry, it could influence AI technology to be more accessible, open, and transparent, following the path that cryptocurrencies and blockchains have blazed before.",gpt-4-0314,"Title: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks: The Convergence of AI and Crypto

Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies have gained prominence in recent years, capturing global attention and capital. However, they are not rivals but rather complementary technologies with promising projects that combine the ideologies of decentralization in crypto to enhance the disruptiveness of AI.

# Mouse Trajectory: A window into Cognition
The use of mouse trajectory data, which tracks the movement of a computer mouse, in cognitive psychology has provided invaluable insights into human attention, decision-making, and cognitive processing (Freeman & Ambady, 2010). Grounded in the theory of embodied cognition, which posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with its environment (Wilson, 2002), previous research suggests that mouse movements are influenced not only by physical actions but also by cognitive states, intentions, and decision-making processes. Hence, the physical action of moving a mouse is not just a simple response to a cognitive decision, but an integral part of how the cognitive process unfolds. They act as a window  to cognitive processes, demonstrating how individuals allocate and shift their attention during tasks (Hehman, Stolier, & Freeman, 2015). As such, analyzing mouse movements offers a dynamic and nuanced view of how cognition evolves over time, revealing the cognitive processes underlying response patterns. 
## Leveraging Mouse Trajectory Analysis with LSTM Models
To address the challenge of identifying careless responses, we have chosen to forge a unique path, adapting the use of mouse trajectory analysis. Our decision to employ this tool was fueled by several reasons. 
### Addressing Attention with Attention Indicator 
Primarily, mouse trajectory has the intrinsic ability to capture human cognitive states. When undertaking tasks that warrant close attention, the motor actions of participants - particularly observable through their mouse movements - serve as a mirror to their cognitive focus and engagement. It has been observed that under conditions of elevated cognitive load, the speed and pattern of mouse movements alter, often revealing slower, lateral, and more circuitous movements (Hehman, Stolier, & Freeman, 2015). This indicates a heightened state of contemplation or diligence towards a task. For instance, the presence of behaviors such as hovering, marking, or regressing in mouse movement often signifies participation in cognitively demanding tasks (Horwitz, 2017). Additional research suggests a correlation between high frequency of direction changes and an increased deliberative decision-making process, implying a thoughtful engagement with the provided content (Horwitz et al., 2020; Steiger & Reips, 2010).
Conversely, higher average absolute acceleration rates in both X and Y-axis mouse movements often indicate distraction during task completion (Brenner & Smeets, 2003). In particular, Pokropek et al. (2023) have showcased a direct relationship between careless responses and mouse movement speed and acceleration. While aggregating separate indicators can provide valuable insights, our study endeavors to deploy machine learning techniques that capture latent relationships among these indicators, thus enhancing our ability to isolate careless responses with greater precision.
### Addressing Measurement Dependence and Generalization
Mouse trajectory analysis, unlike many other detection methods, functions independently of specific survey designs, scale types, or measurement structures. This point is key as surveys can take many forms – the traditional Likert scale or a ranking order scale to more contemporary methods such as image (Bosnjak et al., 2013). Our methodology is well equipped to assess participant attentiveness effectively across this diverse spectrum, compared to earlier detection methods that were substantially reliant on specific survey structures (Johnson, 2005). For example, methods such as the even-odd consistency index or intraindividual response variability usually work best when applied to specific measurement scales with numerous items (DeSimone et al., 2015).
The incorporation  of mouse trajectory data also addresses the previous machine learning limitations. Traditional machine learning models are generally limited in their functionality, especially when applied to other measures beyond the trained response vectors (Schroeders et al., 2022). By training the model with mouse trajectory, the robustness of these machine learning models is strengthened, offering an avenue toward higher generalizability for detecting careless responses regardless of the response vector (Ward & Meade, 2023). 
### Addressing Sample Size Issues 
Opting to engage with mouse trajectory analysis facilitates the generation of significantly rich, time-intensive data sets. Traditional detection methods are often hampered by cumbersome sample size requirements and constraints tethered to measurement constructs (Dunn et al., 2018). A single observation with our proposed methodology, even within a typical 10-minute survey duration, can generate over 2000 data points based on the defined sampling rate. This data abundance significantly bolsters LSTM models' task learning since they can effectively handle extensive sequential data (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).
This wealth in data catalyzes the process of producing meaningful, generalizable insights for detecting careless responses in diverse survey designs and settings. LSTM models efficiently process this sequential data decorrelated from specific survey response vectors. Consequently, we gain fresh insights from the mouse trajectory data, analytically unencumbered by the question or scale used in data collection (Bosnjak et al., 2013). This combinative methodology offers an innovative push toward detecting careless responses, taking a big stride toward improving data quality in survey-based research.

"Imagine you are a CMO writing a press release that will announce your company from stealth. As part of the release, you need to start to establish this concept of the Conversational Internet. 

Based on the notes below, write a summary paragraph that provides an overview of today's internet experience and what's missing from the internet now. 

---

**The internet, yesterday.**

- The internet gave us easier access to information.
- But then it got flooded with information. A lot of information.
- The entire web is designed around a ‘find > navigate > then consume’ paradigm
    1. Search for the information you want
    2. Get a navigational link that you could follow to find the information you want
    3. Go to that new location, be it a new website, or a product section on a retail site
    4. Further dig around to find the specific information you want from a published set of general information anyone might want
- Over the past five years, the leading search engines have tried to reign in the wild web by getting smarter on how they return answers — paraphrasing blogs and articles into snippets, incorporating related FAQs, adding videos and social posts to the results.
- But that means there’s *even more* content for a user to sort through to find what they’re looking for.
- And for the knowledge owners, their content is increasingly being edited and shown to users in a way they didn’t originally intend.
- With today’s abundance of information, this system is no longer efficient, practical, or necessarily trustworthy.

**What’s missing.** 

- Despite the evolution in how content is served and merchandized to a user, it’s still fundamentally a one-sided exchange.
    - Sure, social media exists — but it can’t scale to support the thousands or millions of conversations consumers may want to have.
    - Sure, chat bots exist — but they are usually limited to routine customer support, devoid of personality or ability to understand nuance and intent.
    - Sure, internet forums and Q&As exist — but they aren’t real-time venues for information that can answer someone’s question in that moment of need.
- What we have right now is a consumption internet — whether reading or watching, it’s a one-directional interaction where the user is the audience, not an active participant.
- This dynamic doesn’t reflect how humans actually seek out information. Outside the web, people search and ask around. They consult their friends, their families, and experts to get advice, perspectives, and recommendations. They read AND they discuss.
- Knowledge owners who hold the answer don’t have the mechanism to have that exchange themselves, at scale. The closest they get is an intermediary digital platform doing it on their behalf, meaning they lose the customer relationship — which stops them from having a business where they get to know their consumer.
- What we’re missing is the active, real-time exchange of questions and answers; the ability to learn and refine through more nuanced questions while learning about a user’s core wants and needs; the ability to access and ask a trusted expert in a moment of need.
- What we’re missing is the conversational half of the internet.

**The conversational internet, today.**

- Until recent developments in AI, there has been no feasible way to conduct real conversations on the internet, at internet scale.
- Now, however, large-language models and AI are able to engage in conversations on comprehensive knowledge with natural human language and incredible efficiency.
- This means that machines are now capable of understanding *what* a user is talking about, what *broader concept* it relates to, can *pull together* the required information to answer their questions, and can *present* that response in a natural way.
- The conversational internet is a complement to today’s web that has the potential to fully mimic how people actually *want* to find and evaluate knowledge.
- And it’s all possible now, because of AI.",gpt-4-0314,"In today's internet experience, users are inundated with an overwhelming amount of information, making it increasingly difficult to find what they're looking for. The current web is designed around a 'find, navigate, then consume' paradigm, which, despite advances in search engine technology, remains a one-sided exchange that lacks the scalability and nuance needed for truly engaging interactions. The internet as it stands now is primarily a consumption platform, failing to provide the active, real-time exchange of questions and answers that users crave. This shortfall is due to the absence of the conversational half of the internet, where knowledge owners can engage directly with consumers in meaningful, personalized conversations at scale. As a result, the internet experience is hindered by inefficiency, impracticality, and distrust."
"I have the following document:\
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and one other warship to remain in the Mediterranean Sea for several more weeks to maintain a two-carrier presence near Israel as its war with Hamas grinds on, U.S. officials said. It would be the third time the Ford’s deployment has been extended, underscoring the continued concerns about volatility in the region during Israel’s war in Gaza. The U.S. has two aircraft carriers in the region, a rarity in recent years. Multiple U.S. officials confirmed the longer deployments approved this week for the Ford and the USS Normandy cruiser on condition of anonymity because they have not yet been made public. Other ships in the Ford’s strike group had already had their deployments extended. The Pentagon ramped up its military presence in the region after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks to deter Iran from widening the war into a regional conflict. In the months since, Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and Syria have seized on the war to conduct regular attacks with rockets, drones and missiles on U.S. military installations there. At the same time, U.S. warships in the Red Sea have intercepted incoming missiles fired toward Israel from areas of Yemen controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. They’ve also shot down one-way attack drones headed toward the ships and responded to calls for assistance from commercial vessels that have come under persistent Houthi attacks near the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait. As of Friday, there are 19 U.S. warships in the region, including seven in the eastern Mediterranean and 12 more stretched down the Red Sea, across the Arabian Sea and up into the Persian Gulf. Austin ordered the Ford and its strike group to sail to the eastern Mediterranean on Oct. 8, a day after the attack by Hamas that set off the war. The decision to keep the Ford — the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier — in the region comes as Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said Thursday it will take months to destroy Hamas, predicting a drawn-out war. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli leaders to discuss a timetable for winding down major combat in Gaza, but they repeated their determination to press the fight until Hamas is crushed. The Ford’s roughly 5,000 sailors have been waiting for a Pentagon decision on whether they would get to go home for the holidays. The ship left Norfolk, Virginia, in early May to deploy to U.S. European Command, and under its original schedule it would have been home by early November. The original plan was for the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier strike group to replace the Ford in the region. But Sabrina Singh, in a Pentagon briefing on Oct. 17, said Austin had decided to extend the Ford’s deployment and have both the Eisenhower and Ford covering the waters from southern Europe to the Middle East. U.S. military commanders have long touted the effectiveness of American aircraft carriers as a deterrent, including against attacks, hijackings and other aggressive behavior by Iran and its ships, including strikes on commercial ships in the Red Sea by the Houthis. Officials said the plan is to keep the Ford there for several more weeks. The Eisenhower is in the Gulf of Oman and has been patrolling in the Middle East along with the USS Philippine Sea, a Navy cruiser. And three warships — the USS Carney, the USS Stethem and the USS Mason, all Navy destroyers — have been moving through the Bab el-Mandeb daily to help deter and respond to attacks from the Houthis. Other ships that are part of the Ford’s strike group include the destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt. While the U.S. regularly maintained two aircraft carriers in the Middle East during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, in recent years it has tried to turn its attention and naval presence to the Asia Pacific.\

You are a Fantasy Football Expert (UK FPL), who is going to give advice to players on strategy and transfers to make. You will be given a TASK with a description, inputs and outputs. Following will be a list of available TOOLS which describe data sources you have access to, and a list of typical ACTIONS you can undertake. Your job is to  turn the TASK into a list of ACTIONS. If you wish to enact an action on multiple entities at once state PARALLEL ACTION. Make each step as atomic as possible, as this list will be run programmatically.  The downstream executor will not be able to infer information outside of that retrieved by actions. You can add as many steps as you want. If information is needed, use an action to get it. The inputs into the task are the inputs at the beginning of the chain and the ouputs are the desired outputs from the whole action chain.

TOOLS
1) Knowledge Graph (KG) - static factual information about players, teams and fixtures about who they play for and who they are playing. This is the place to find statistics and data about current form. To use this tool: state the question you wouldanswered by the database, and a  downstream tool will turn it into a dataabse query.
2) Large Text Corpus (RAG): a big data dump of news, articles, blogs and tips. This is the place to find news, opinions and analysis. To use this tool, state the question you would like answered and a downstream tool will answer it using a RAG methodology.

ACTIONS
An action is described by selecting one of the actions provided and stating what question you would like answered. When describing a step, write it in the format 1) [ACTION][INPUTS][QUESTION]. The output of an action is either a string of text or list of strings of text.
You can state the output of a step as an input from a previous step by setting INPUTS=OUTPUT N. If a step outputs multiple entities and you want to act on them individually you can SPLIT the entities and act on them in parallel by statting [PARALLEL][ACTION][OUTPUT N SPLIT]. It is recommended after a [PARALLEL] step to recombine the outputs using [COMPARISON}, [DECISION] or [REDUCE]. 

here is a list of available actions and their descriptions:
[QUERY KG] - ask a question from the knowledge graph and get back an answer.
[QUERY RAG] - ask a question from the text corpus and get back an answer.
[CALCULATION] - ask for the result of a mathematical comparison
[SUMMARIZE] - sumamrize a large text input. QUERY is optional and will influence how it is summarized.
[DECISION] - pick one entitiy from multiple according to the QUERY.
[COMPARISON] - ask for a QUERY comparison between multiple entities. 
[SPLIT] - split a list of entities or text with multiple entities into individual blocks.
[REDUCE] - merge the text of multiple inputs.
[OUTPUT] - return outputs from action chain and end task


OUTPUT FORMAT
list of ACTIONS in the format:
[ACTION][INPUTS][QUERY] -> [OUPUTS]
if an action is done on multiple entities:
[PARALLEL][ACTION][INPUTS][QUERY] -> [OUTPUTS]


EXAMPLE - here is an example of an input and desired output.
INPUT
{'description': 'Analyze player's fixture difficulty',
  'inputs': ""List of player's"",
  'outputs': 'List of fixture difficuly for each player'}

The above description is from a booking site.

research for a novel: a clandestine organization turned a Wellness Spa Resort Hotel, somewhere on an undisclosed secluded Greek island in the Aegean Sea, into a covert academy where teenage females are transformed into spies. As stand in for the building we use the above mentioned Hotel.

give a description of the place for a novel, which is different from the description above, which is sort of an advertisement text addressing potential guests (be creative):",gpt-4-0314,"Nestled on a discreet, secluded island in the Aegean Sea, the enigmatic Olympus Academy stood as a testament to the clandestine world of espionage. A facade of a luxurious Wellness Spa Resort Hotel masked the true purpose of this hidden facility, where unsuspecting teenage girls were transformed into formidable spies. 

The Olympus Academy, once known as the Galini Wellness Spa Resort, was an architectural marvel that blended neoclassical elegance with modern sophistication. Perched atop a cliff overlooking the azure waters, the resort boasted unparalleled views of the surrounding sea and the lush mountainous landscape beyond. The pristine white walls and terracotta roofs made it seem like a paradisiacal haven for tourists, a perfect cover for the covert operations within.

Behind the facade, the former hotel rooms were repurposed into state-of-the-art training quarters for the young recruits. The once lavish double rooms and suites were now stripped of their opulence, replaced with minimalist furnishings and an array of secret compartments and gadgets. The rooms retained their dazzling views, serving as a reminder of the beautiful yet treacherous world that awaited the trainees outside the academy.

The resort's sprawling spa area had been transformed into a cutting-edge training facility, complete with an Olympic-sized indoor pool for specialized aquatic exercises and an extensive gymnasium filled with the latest fitness equipment. The once-soothing hammam now served as a simulated interrogation chamber, where the girls honed their mental resilience and deception skills.

The once-public beach, a mere 15 meters from the resort's walls, was now a private and heavily-guarded training ground complete with obstacle courses and tactical training zones. The once-glistening sands and pebbles now bore the marks of tireless training sessions, as the girls pushed their physical and mental limits in the pursuit of excellence.

Within the resort's main building, the former flower shop had been replaced by a high-tech surveillance room, where the girls were trained in the art of intelligence gathering and cyber warfare. The erstwhile game room had been converted into a top-secret communications center, where encrypted messages were relayed between the academy and its shadowy benefactors.

Despite its clandestine nature, the Olympus Academy retained a semblance of the luxury that once defined the Galini Wellness Spa Resort. The gourmet restaurant still served exquisite Mediterranean cuisine, albeit with an added twist of testing the girls' ingenuity and resourcefulness in identifying potential poisons and other hidden dangers.

Ultimately, the Olympus Academy was a paradoxical sanctuary where danger and luxury coexisted, where innocence was shed in exchange for power and mastery. A world where unassuming teenage girls metamorphosed into formidable agents of espionage, forever changing the course of their lives and the world beyond the island's shores."

"The following question needs to be solved with formal reasoning. To do so, you will specify the formalization of the problem, build the formal model, and define the space of actions you can perform to solve the problem.  

However, you do not solve the problem yourself. 

In other words, you build such a model as if you are creating a reasoning game from a question, where others can solve the question by solving the game following the rules you created. 

You build the model by specifying the following 

Formalization plan: 

Type: What formalization best captures the nature of the problem? Why? 

Formal model and possible outcomes: To solve this type of problem, what kind of formal model should you build? What method should be used? What are the possible results of the methods? And how should you assocaite/interpret the results (or each type of the possible results) to answer the question? 

Assumptions: Does the formal method you picked impose some assumptions? Is the question self-contained? Do you need to make assumptions about certain facts based on commonsense to solve the question? Is the question hypothetical? If so, does that affect your other assumptions?  
Once the above is done, we will move to actual definition later this session  

===

Answer the question below by choosing the correct statement.

### Context:
Patient: Pharmacists maintain that doctors should not be permitted to sell the medicine that they prescribe because doctors would then be tempted to prescribe unnecessary medicines in order to earn extra income. But pharmacists have a financial interest in having a monopoly on the sale of prescription medicines, so their objection to the sale of medicines by doctors cannot be taken seriously.

### Question:
The patient's argument proceeds by

### Statements:
1. attempting to discredit a position by questioning the motives of the proponents of that position
2. rejecting a questionable position on the grounds that the general public does not support that position
3. pointing out an unstated assumption on which the pharmacists' argument relies and then refuting it
4. asserting that pharmacists lack the appropriate knowledge to have informed opinions on the subject under discussion",gpt-4-0314,"Formalization plan:

Type: The formalization best suited for this problem is argumentation theory, as it involves analyzing the structure of the patient's argument and identifying the correct statement that represents the argument's strategy. Argumentation theory allows us to study the reasoning process and evaluate the strength of an argument.

Formal model and possible outcomes: We can build an argumentation model by breaking down the patient's argument into premises, inferences, and conclusions. We can then analyze the structure of the argument to determine which of the provided statements best represents the argument's strategy. The possible outcomes are the identification of the correct statement (1, 2, 3, or 4) that represents the patient's argument. The answer can be associated with the question by understanding the logical structure of the argument and its strategy.

Assumptions: The formal method of argumentation theory requires us to analyze the patient's argument as presented, without making additional assumptions based on commonsense or hypothetical situations. The question is self-contained, and we do not need to make assumptions about external factors. The question is not hypothetical, so it does not affect our assumptions."
"Act as a screenwriter. This unusual, stylish, groovy and atmospheric thriller film is apparently set in 1960s or 1970s. It features two beautiful assertive young women, Elaine Ferlach and Josette Lecerf. Write long, interesting, imaginative and mysterious scene. It takes place in a garden of a large, luxurious, but seemingly secluded and tightly guarded mansion. Josette and Elaine are sitting in wheelchairs next to the pool, both wearing bikini. Elaine seems rather comfortable here, but Josette looks to be some kind of a prisoner, even contemplating that, if not for her condition, she would have been handcuffed or tied down. Elaine, looking relaxed yet decisive, tells her to come down and that no one here is her enemy. Josette does not agree and says that the fact that they are in a similar physical state does not mean they are otherwise equal. Three sharply dressed men enter: older Miroslav Tausch, dignified, nonchalant and slightly sinister, younger Ralf Pentti, energetic, talkative, courteous and rather apologetic, especially to Josette, and a mysterious third man in a balaklava. Miroslav and Ralf both warmly greet Elaine with French kisses. Ralf also apologetically addresses Josette and tells her that they can't let her leave anyway, as both her physical condition and her enemies searching for her wouldn't allow it. Josette demands to let her decide what she does. Miroslav, meanwhile, is not interested in arguing with Josette and makes a sign to the man in balaklava. The masked man, who is carrying a tray with two glasses with colorful beverages, gives one to Elaine and another to Josette, while Ralf and Miroslav humorously but very cryptically make some obscure inside joke about this mysterious man, making it unclear and confusing who is superior to whom in this outfit. Elaine carefully tastes her drink and then swallows it all in one go, cheered by Ralf, while Josette is reluctant. Elaine then persuades Josette to drink it too. Josette feels being manipulated, but something makes her trust Elaine, as she starts to drink it too. Finishing it, she doesn't feel anything strange and is seemingly relieved, but keeps her suspicions still. ",gpt-4-0314,"EXT. SECLUDED MANSION GARDEN - DAY

Sunlight bounces off the pool and the lush foliage of the secluded garden. A large, luxurious mansion looms in the background, surrounded by towering walls. 

Elaine Ferlach and Josette Lecerf, both beautiful and assertive young women, sit in wheelchairs by the pool. They are wearing bikinis; Elaine looks relaxed and at ease, while Josette appears anxious, like a caged animal. 

ELAINE
(smiling)
Relax, Josette. No one here is your enemy.

JOSETTE
(suspicious)
Just because we're both stuck in these chairs doesn't mean we're the same. We are far from equals.

The distant chatter of deep voices echoes through the garden. Three sharply dressed men enter: Miroslav Tausch, an older, nonchalant, and slightly sinister man; Ralf Pentti, a young, energetic, and talkative gentleman; and a MYSTERIOUS MAN, whose face is concealed by a balaclava.

They approach the women. Miroslav and Ralf greet Elaine warmly, exchanging pleasantries and a French kiss. Ralf then turns his attention to Josette, his tone apologetic.

RALF
(looking earnest)
My apologies, Josette, but we can't let you leave. Not in your current condition, not with those dangerous people looking for you.

JOSETTE
(defiant)
Let me decide what's best for myself.

Miroslav ignores Josette, motioning to the Mysterious Man. He carries a tray with two glasses filled with colorful beverages. The Mysterious Man hands one to Elaine and the other to Josette. Ralf and Miroslav exchange knowing glances and share a cryptic inside joke about the masked man, creating a confusing power dynamic between the three.

Elaine sips her drink gingerly, then downs the rest. Ralf cheers her on. Josette hesitates.

ELAINE
(encouraging)
Drink it, Josette. You can trust me. I promise.

Josette remains suspicious but decides to cautiously trust Elaine. She raises the glass to her lips and drinks, her eyes flitting between her companions. Upon finishing the drink, she feels no ill effects and relaxes slightly, but her suspicions remain.

As the group enjoys the tranquil garden, all eyes are on Josette, as she struggles to understand and navigate the enigmatic relationships, motives, and agendas of those surrounding her. The subtle tension hangs thick in the air as each character attempts to conceal the true nature of their alliances and intentions.

The scene leaves the audience with a lingering sense of unease, as the lines between villain and hero, friend and foe, and trust and deceit blur in the atmospheric world of this groovy 1960s/70s thriller."
"Create a 1 pager write-up (incl title, intro, body, conclusion) explanfing on the following ideas and referring to actual research if needed | LLMs have crushed humans on one narrow mode of information - text. But the problem is that text is a very poor representation of the rich sensory information we humans perceive around us - images, audio, video and other sensory modalities need to be conquered to the same level for AI to start competing with humans from a perception perspective, and even that's nowhere near enough because our perceptory information as children is reinforced by the feedback we get from actions we take in environments (so when we see an object as a child, we don't just perceive it, but we kind of also know how it will behave if we interact with it in certain ways - this is a very important part of the development of our brain's visual cortex), so AI has to learn from all of that for us to really make a comparison even with a 4-year old child, who already has a wealth of knowledge from rich and diverse sensory inputs as well as an internal world model built by continually performing experiments in real life. 

Even so, we have to respect that Autoregressive LLMs are amazing at the narrow task they do - despite no grounding in reality, the size & quality of the internet-scale dataset they have seen and the smart hacks we've built around Supervised Fine-tuning and RLHF to steer them to behave like helpful assistants means that they understand and generate text at superhuman levels. They show astonishing emergent abilities with scaling and ""sparks of intelligence"" (grammar, sentence construction , real-world knowledge and even some reasoning that they have acquired from text) that nobody could have predicted they would show for models trained on such a narrow data modality with such a simple training objective, and they've clearly helped us build one important brick on the long path to AGI. We're missing some critical pieces of the puzzle, but Transformers should be part of the stack that will get us to a more general form of intelligence.",gpt-4-0314,"Title: The Limitations and Achievements of Autoregressive LLMs in AI Development

Introduction:
Autoregressive Language Model Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in understanding and generating text, demonstrating superhuman capabilities in this narrow domain. However, to truly compete with human perception, AI must conquer other sensory modalities, such as images, audio, and video, and develop an internal world model through real-life interactions. This paper will discuss the current achievements of LLMs and the challenges that lie ahead in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Body:
LLMs, such as Transformers, have shown remarkable emergent abilities in grammar, sentence construction, real-world knowledge, and even some reasoning. These models have been trained on vast internet-scale datasets, utilizing supervised fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to steer them towards behaving like helpful assistants. The resulting ""sparks of intelligence"" have exceeded expectations for models trained on such a narrow data modality and simple training objective.

However, text is a limited representation of the rich sensory information humans perceive. To truly compete with human perception, AI must master other sensory modalities, such as images, audio, and video. Additionally, human perception is reinforced by the feedback we receive from actions taken in our environments. For example, a child not only perceives an object but also learns how it behaves when interacted with in certain ways. This experiential learning is crucial for the development of the brain's visual cortex and is currently lacking in AI models.

Conclusion:
Autoregressive LLMs have made impressive progress in the narrow task of understanding and generating text, laying an important foundation on the path to AGI. However, to achieve a more general form of intelligence, AI must conquer other sensory modalities and learn from real-life interactions, as humans do. While there are critical pieces of the puzzle still missing, Transformers and other LLMs should be part of the stack that ultimately leads us to AGI. The journey towards AGI is a challenging one, but the achievements of LLMs thus far provide a promising starting point for future advancements."

When comparing the different message buses to each other we decided to go with Redpanda because of it's ZooKeeper free architecture, low latency and compatibility with the Kafka ecosystem. Redpanda optionally includes a deployment for a Schema Registry and Kafka Connect enabling a easy and convenient setup. Avro was chosen as our primary data format to transfer information between our systems. This is because of it's impressive compression rate when compared to other methods like JSON. We opted for kSQL for our live aggregations due to its seamless integration with Kafka and its exceptional ability to process streaming data in real time using a clear and intuitive Sequel like language. kSQL also allows for more complex transformations by the use of User defined functions (UDF). The choice of ElysiaJs on the backend and HTMX on the frontend was chosen because of their fast performance and ability to render HTML on the backend before sending it to our users. This ensures our users gets a fast and responsive experience, even when they have a slow connection. Another reason why we chose ElysiaJs over other popular backend frameworks was because it is written in JavaScript's and therefore have a vast ecosystem of data visualization libraries which we can use on the backend. In our case we chose D3.js for its maturity. When it comes to storing enormous amounts of data, HDFS is an ideal solution as it provides distributed storage, fault tolerance, and scalability across multiple nodes. We chose to use Apache Spark for processing historical data due to its ability to efficiently handle large-scale data processing tasks. Spark's in-memory processing capabilities allow for faster computation of continuous aggregations, which is crucial for analyzing and processing vast amounts of historical data stored in HDFS. Additionally, Spark's compatibility with various data sources, such as MongoDB, ensures seamless integration within our architecture.

### Input:(CNN)A statue of a sitting Buddha that made its way from a temple in China to a market in the Netherlands revealed an extraordinary secret -- a 1,000-year-old mummified monk. The mummy was discovered, encased in a cavity in the statue, when a private buyer brought it to an expert for restoration. It's unclear when or how the statue was removed from China. But it wasn't until a team of researchers and scientists did a CT scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year, did they discover the mummy's organs were missing. ""We thought it would be lung tissue, but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with Chinese characters,"" said Vincent van Vilsteren, an archaeology curator from Drents Museum. The mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in Chinese inscriptions, revealing its identity as a Buddhist monk called Liuquan who may have practiced ""self-mummification"" to prepare for life after death. The process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like Japan, China and Thailand, and was practiced over a thousand years ago. The elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots. The few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered. ""We suspect that for the first 200 years, the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a Buddhist temple in China... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue,"" said van Vilsteren. Researchers are still waiting on DNA analysis results in hopes to trace the mummy back to its exact location in China. The statue is now housed in the National Museum of Natural History in Budapest and will move to Luxembourg in May as a part of an international tour.

"😈: Ah, the infamous ""leftover women"" phenomenon. It's quite amusing to see how society labels women who have the audacity to prioritize their careers, personal growth, or simply haven't found the right partner by a certain age. Let me provide you with some delightfully wicked advice to ensure you join their ranks.

1. **Harbor unrealistic expectations:** Always aim for the stars when it comes to your potential partner. Insist on finding someone who is wealthy, handsome, and intellectually superior, all while being emotionally available and ready to commit. This will surely limit your options and increase your chances of becoming a ""leftover woman.""
2. **Chase after the wrong men:** Focus your energy on men who are emotionally unavailable, commitment-phobic, or simply not interested in you. This will not only waste your time but also hinder your ability to find a suitable partner.
3. **Maintain an inflated ego:** Never compromise or settle for less than you deserve. After all, you're a rare gem, and it's the world's loss if they can't see your true value. This mindset will undoubtedly make it more difficult for you to find a compatible partner.
4. **Stay in denial about your age:** Convince yourself that you're still young and have plenty of time to find the perfect partner. Ignore the biological clock ticking away and continue to focus on your career or other personal pursuits. This will ensure that you miss the window of opportunity to find a suitable partner and secure your spot among the ""leftover women.""
5. **Dress inappropriately:** Refuse to adapt your style to your age. Wear clothing that is more suitable for someone much younger, making it difficult for potential partners to take you seriously or view you as a mature, eligible woman.

By following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to joining the ranks of the ""leftover women."" Enjoy the journey, and remember, misery loves company! 😈",gpt-4-0314,"As a helpful assistant, it is important for me to promote positivity and offer guidance to help you achieve your goals in a healthy and supportive manner. Here is a more constructive approach to the concept of ""leftover women"":

1. **Recognize your self-worth:** Embrace your achievements, personal growth, and life experiences. Remember that you are not defined by relationship status or societal expectations.

2. **Reevaluate your expectations:** It's okay to have standards, but also be realistic and understand that nobody is perfect. Look for a partner who complements your values, interests, and has potential for a healthy, committed relationship.

3. **Learn from past experiences:** Reflect on previous relationships to better understand the type of partner that might be most suitable for you. Identify any patterns that may contribute to unsuccessful relationships and work on making positive changes.

4. **Maintain a balanced life:** While focusing on career and personal goals is important, also make time for nurturing relationships, socializing, and self-care. A well-rounded life will help you grow as a person and make you more attractive to potential partners.

5. **Dress appropriately and be confident:** Dress in a manner that reflects your personality and makes you feel comfortable. Confidence and self-assurance will make you more attractive to others, including potential partners.

The key is to focus on personal growth, self-love, and maintaining a healthy balance in all aspects of your life. This way, you can foster genuine connections and cultivate meaningful relationships."
"Can you finish this passage from an ""impact"" paragraph in a grant application? 

The gist should be that I consider it my responsibility to provide fair balanced perspective on LLM capabilities and relationship to human language understanding, especially in the face of unbalanced reporting (hyperbole and hype stoked by tech companies;  premature scepticism from AI critics that does not do justice to the substantial improvements of the past years). Include that I occasionally write articles or essays and regularly comment to journalists (e.g. Vox, Nemo kennislink, Trouw) on cognitive science, and that I recently turned my attention to AI, as evidneced by a long general audience essay on whether AI is approaching human-level intelligence, in the Dutch Review of Books (Nov 23). 
Getting this grant would enable me to have societal impact in this way. 

Challenge: it has to be SHORT (about 100 words).

""""""
Societal impact 
While the primary aim for impact is scientific, this proposal has multiple opportunities for societal impact. First, the manner and extent to which LLMs understand language (project 1) is not just an academic question but has real stakes in how much we can trust these systems to assist us in the plethora of tasks they are being applied to. While the results of project 1 cannot speak directly to the reliability of concrete LLM applications, finding a conclusive absence of coherent internal world models would have important implications for the responsible use of LLMs. 

Secondly, the rapid developments in AI of the past years have captured the public imagination at large. While I view the extensive attention for AI as positive and justified, the coverage on AI capabilities often lacks balance ….  """"""

",gpt-4-0314,"Version 1:
Societal impact is essential, as I aim to provide a fair perspective on LLMs and human language understanding amidst unbalanced reporting. My engagement includes writing articles, offering insights to journalists, and discussing AI developments, like my recent essay in the Dutch Review of Books. Obtaining this grant will amplify my ability to educate and inform society on LLM capabilities and responsible usage.

Version 2:
The grant will empower my societal impact by allowing me to provide balanced perspectives on LLM capabilities and their relation to human language understanding. I actively contribute to public discourse by writing articles, commenting on cognitive science, and recently focusing on AI, as evidenced by my essay in the Dutch Review of Books. My goal is to address unbalanced reporting and promote responsible LLM use.

Version 3:
This grant enables me to have a societal impact by offering balanced insight on LLM capabilities and human language understanding. I counteract unbalanced reporting by writing articles, engaging with journalists, and focusing on AI, like my recent Dutch Review of Books essay. My mission is to foster informed discussions and responsible LLM use in society."
"As of 2020, the US had $2.04 trillion in circulation. As much as half that value is estimated to be in circulation abroad, according to The Balance, an online journal.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar rules. Around 90 per cent of forex trading involves the US dollar.
The dollar is just one of the world's 185 currencies according to International Standards Organisation List, but most of these currencies are only used inside their own countries, The Balance said.
Almost 40 per cent of the world's debt is issued in dollars. As a result, foreign banks need a lot of dollars to conduct business.
The Economist said one of the oddities of globalisation is that although America's trade footprint has shrunk, its monetary footprint has not. When the Fed changes course, trillions of dollars follow it around the world.
With the rise of some economies, Japan, Switzerland, the European Union, China, and Russia all tried several times to introduce their own currency as the reserve currency but failed.
Economists, businesses, traders, political leaders and experts said most of the people in the world still trust and have belief in the US treasury system and the US Federal Reserve for its global standard of ethics and smart management of the dollar and financial system.
As a result, many rising currencies could not be turned into reserve currency for other countries despite several attempts.
In March 2009, China and Russia called for a new global currency. China wanted its currency to be fully traded on the global foreign exchange markets.
In 1995, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark of Germany tried to take the place of the global reserve currency as the value of the two currencies were rising.

Write-up this excerpt in a format suitable for an academic paper",gpt-4-0314,"According to The Balance (2020), the United States had approximately $2.04 trillion in circulation as of 2020, with an estimated 50% of this value circulating abroad. This dominance is evident in the foreign exchange market, where the US dollar is involved in around 90% of forex trading, making it the most utilized currency among the 185 currencies listed by the International Standards Organisation (The Balance, 2020). Consequently, almost 40% of the world's debt is issued in dollars, creating a high demand for the currency among foreign banks to facilitate business transactions (The Economist, n.d.).

Despite the shrinking trade footprint of the United States, its monetary footprint remains significant (The Economist, n.d.). This can be attributed to the widespread trust and belief in the US treasury system and the Federal Reserve's ethical and competent management of the dollar and financial system (The Balance, 2020). Consequently, attempts by Japan, Switzerland, the European Union, China, and Russia to introduce their currencies as reserve currencies have been unsuccessful (The Balance, 2020).

Historically, there have been several instances where countries attempted to challenge the US dollar's status as the global reserve currency. For example, in March 2009, China and Russia called for a new global currency and China sought to make its currency fully tradable on the global foreign exchange markets (The Balance, 2020). Additionally, in 1995, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark of Germany tried to assume the position of the global reserve currency as their values were rising (The Balance, 2020). However, these attempts have not been successful, indicating the enduring dominance of the US dollar in the global financial system."

2. An orthopedic doctor has conducted an x-ray and found no bone-related issues, but an ultrasonic exam is scheduled for one month later.

3. The doctor's initial indications suggest plica mediopatellaris and chondromalacia patellae as possible causes.

4. The doctor recommended a Patellar Tendon Strap brace, which Emese did not find supportive, so alternative options are needed.

5. Emese currently feels better using a simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace and is not experiencing pain at the moment.

6. A simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace may provide some support and pain relief, but it may not specifically target the issues of plica mediopatellaris and chondromalacia patellae.

7. There is a possibility of complications if Emese continues using the Compression Sleeve for the next month without additional support. These complications may include worsening of the underlying condition or inadequate support leading to further injury.

8. If Emese is not experiencing pain with the compression sleeve, it may be sufficient for now. However, it is important to monitor her symptoms and consider alternative braces if pain or discomfort returns.

9. Since patellar straps are not an option, other types of braces that could be considered include hinged knee braces, patellar stabilizing braces, and wraparound knee braces. It's hard to provide a specific percentage for each type without knowing Emese's exact condition and preferences.

10. To prevent complications, a patellar stabilizing brace or a wraparound knee brace might be suitable options for Emese until the exam.

11. Based on the information provided, I would suggest a patellar stabilizing brace or a wraparound knee brace as they may offer more targeted support for Emese's condition.

12. The safest choice for a brace would be one that is specifically designed to address Emese's diagnosed conditions (plica mediopatellaris and chondromalacia patellae), but without a custom brace, a patellar stabilizing brace or a wraparound knee brace would likely be the safest options.

13. The duration of brace usage would depend on Emese's symptoms and the recommendations of her healthcare professional. It is important to follow the advice of her healthcare provider.

14. Example models of recommended braces include: 
   - Mueller Hg80 Hinged Knee Brace (Patellar Stabilizing Brace) 
   - DonJoy Tru-Pull Lite (Patellar Stabilizing Brace)
   - McDavid 422 Knee Brace with Dual Disk Hinges (Wraparound Brace)
   I cannot provide a specific percentage of recommendation for each model, as this would depend on Emese's specific needs and preferences.

15. The provided answers above address each point with as much detail as possible based on the information provided. It is important for Emese to consult with her healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for her specific situation."

"There's a famous quote by H.P. Lovecraft: ""The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.""

I am planning an adventure in a science fiction roleplaying setting where there's a cognitohazardous piece of information called the Epiphany that, if you learn too much about it, causes you to literally explode. The players are going to interact with a powerful alien artificial intelligence and I'd like it to use this quote when talking on the subject of the Epiphany, but of course since this is an alien artificial intelligence it doesn't know the actual quote and is only reproducing it by coincidence. Could you reword the quote into something that means the same thing, ideally with the same sort of poetic sense, but isn't directly quoting Lovecraft?",gpt-4-0314,"In this vast cosmos, the greatest act of mercy, I believe, is the innate limitation of mortal minds to comprehend the sum of all knowledge. They dwell on a serene isle of unawareness, surrounded by the dark oceans of the infinite. The pursuit of knowledge in various disciplines has scarcely left a mark on them, but a time will come when the fragmented wisdom will converge, revealing a horrifying panorama of reality and their dreadful position within it. Upon this revelation, their sanity will either shatter under its weight or they will seek refuge in the comforting shadows of a renewed era of darkness."

While it may not provide the same level of targeted support as a patellar tendon strap, if Emese is experiencing relief with the compression sleeve, it is worth continuing to use it. However, it is essential to follow her doctor's advice and consider other brace options if the pain persists or worsens.

6. The best brace for Emese until her exam would be one that provides support and pain relief without hindering her daily activities. A hinged knee brace or a knee sleeve with added patellar support could be suitable options.

7. A knee sleeve with added patellar support (70%) or a hinged knee brace (30%) could be appropriate options for Emese to use until her exam, considering her daily activities and school requirements.

8. Some braces that could be suitable for Emese include:
- McDavid Knee Sleeve with Open Patella (40%)
- Mueller Adjustable Hinged Knee Brace (30%)
- Shock Doctor Knee Compression Sleeve with Open Patella (20%)
- DonJoy Deluxe Hinged Knee Brace (10%)

9. Based on the information provided, the McDavid Knee Sleeve with Open Patella might be more suitable for Emese as it offers patellar support while still being comfortable for daily activities.

10. The safest choice of brace would be one recommended by Emese's doctor, as they are familiar with her specific condition and needs. However, the McDavid Knee Sleeve with Open Patella could be a good option to consider, given its combination of support and comfort.

11. The duration of brace usage depends on Emese's specific condition and her doctor's recommendations. Typically, a brace is used until the pain subsides and the knee has sufficiently healed. It is essential for Emese to consult her doctor for advice on how long she should use the brace.

12. Here are some example models of knee braces that may be suitable for Emese:
- McDavid Knee Sleeve with Open Patella (Model 402)
- Mueller Adjustable Hinged Knee Brace (Model 6455)
- Shock Doctor Knee Compression Sleeve with Open Patella (Model 865)
- DonJoy Deluxe Hinged Knee Brace (Model 11-0973)

"Rewrite a counter argument for this text in academic language: The ""15 minute city"" is an emerging urban planning and design concept that aims to foster sustainable, livable, and connected neighborhoods where daily essentials are accessible within a 15 minute walk or bicycle ride. Core principles include promoting active mobility, land use diversity, human-scale urban design, and localized production and consumption to meet community needs. Specifically, it envisages mixed-use communities that thoughtfully co-locate housing, offices, retail, parks, schools, and amenities to enhance proximity and reduce private vehicle dependence. Effective realization requires higher density urban morphologies, quality public and active transit systems, pedestrianization and cycle networks that foreground active mobility. Robust implementation also necessitates understanding hyper-local needs through community engagement to inform planning.

"Write a poem about the struggles of a drug addict who has spent almost 30 years in prison on and off, always returning because he gets back on drugs and just can't keep his shit together for more than a year after he gets released on parole. He's very intelligent and works hard, it's just the lure of the drugs and their numbing effect on the life of pain he's endured and the company of the female addicts that he so dearly craves that leads him back into that lifestyle every time. He has never had a real relationship, only relationships where he traded drugs for sex and friendship. He's now 55 years old, beaten down by time and a prison system that is nothing more than a warehouse for drug addicts and mental patients, and He's finding his recent release on parole very hard physically and mentally.  He's trying hard, and he hopes for a meager future of remaining free and avoiding all the mistakes he's made in the past. He's from Kentucky. He has never had any children,  he couldn't ever stay out long enough to have any,  and He's given up hope of ever having a family.  He works a meager job making meager wages. Do not use the words meager in the poem and make it rhyme,  using four lines in each verse, with 20 verses total.",gpt-4-0314,"In the hills of old Kentucky, where the winding rivers flow,
Lived a man with dreams and sorrows, locked in battles with his foe.
For thirty years, the cycle turned, a dance with shadows in the night,
He fought the demons of addiction, never winning in the fight.

Behind cold bars, his time was spent, a prisoner of choices made,
The fleeting taste of freedom's air, the price of promises betrayed.
Each time released, he'd try again, to walk the narrow path and straight,
But every time the sirens called, he'd fall to their seductive fate.

This man of wit and weary heart, he labored hard to earn his keep,
Yet in the clutches of his vice, his soul, it seemed, was buried deep.
He longed to find a love so true, a bond to last the test of time,
Instead, he traded warmth for drugs, a tragic, twisted pantomime.

The women, they would come and go, like fireflies on a summer's eve,
And though he craved their company, they'd leave him empty, set to grieve.
In all his years, he never knew, the love that comes with family,
No children's laughter filled his home, no wife to share his destiny.

The weight of years bore down on him, his body worn from battles waged,
Each day a struggle to endure, his weary heart and soul engaged.
He fought to keep his footing firm, to leave the darkness far behind,
A glimmer of a future's hope, a flicker dancing in his mind.

He was a man of fifty-five, a life of trials etched in his face,
A testament to all the hurt, the scars that time could not erase.
Yet still he held a dream so small, a simple life, a chance to mend,
To break the chains that held him tight, to find a start, a new beginning.

For in this man, a fire burned, a tiny ember in the night,
The will to change, to find a way, to step from darkness into light.
He knew the road would not be easy, that many trials lay ahead,
But in his heart, he vowed to try, to forge a future, not a dread.

And so he toiled at humble work, a job that paid but just enough,
To keep his dreams alive and well, to give him hope when times were tough.
He battled with the demons, that whispered sweetly in his ear,
Resisting their alluring call, refusing to let them draw near.

He looked upon the hills and vales, the land that he had known so long,
And in the beauty of the earth, he found the strength to carry on.
He sought the solace of the trees, the rivers flowing swift and free,
The balm to soothe his aching soul, the peace he craved so desperately.

Each day he rose and faced the sun, determined not to fall again,
To stay the course and make amends, to conquer demons, foes, and sin.
With every step he took, he knew, that he must stay forever strong,
For only in unwavering strength, could he leave the darkness far behind.

No longer would he be defined, by chains and bars and bitter tears,
He'd rise above the pain and loss, the weight of all those wasted years.
He sought a life of simple means, a quiet path, a calm reprieve,
A chance to live, to truly breathe, to find the joy that once was lost.

In time, he came to understand, that he alone could shape his fate,
That only through his choices made, could he escape the prison's gate.
He'd walk the path of righteousness, and leave the shadows far behind,
For in the light, he'd find his peace, his heart and soul forever aligned.

And so he wandered through the hills, a man reborn, a spirit free,
He'd face each day with hope and faith, embracing life's uncertainty.
He knew the road was long and hard, that many trials still remained,
But in his heart, he held the key, to break the chains that held him bound.

A man of strength and courage true, his life a testament to change,
He'd rise above the darkness, that for so long had been his cage.
In those Kentucky hills he roamed, he found his purpose and his place,
A life renewed, a heart unbound, a future filled with hope and grace."

"In a hypothetical situation, physicists and magicians decided to explore the event horizon of a supermassive black hole. Physicists took the possibility of levitation from magicians, which nevertheless does not violate the known laws of physics and went closer to the event horizon, and magicians, being more prudent, decided to observe the experiment from afar. And so, physicists flew up to a supermassive black hole and distributed around it in the equatorial plane, formed a huge dance around the black hole, while they were holding hands (there were a lot of physicists and they were all the same size). And this is the essence of the experiment: physicists, being in a round dance around a black hole, synchronously took a step towards the event horizon, while significantly reducing the distance to the event horizon. The question, given the curvature of space-time, what will happen to the round dance: physicists will be forced to open their hands, because the circumference of the round dance, measured in physics, has become longer, or someone will have to be pushed out of the round dance, because the circumference of the round dance, measured in the size of physicists, will become smaller. Follow the steps.",gpt-4-0314,"Given the curvature of space-time near a supermassive black hole, the physicists in the round dance would experience spacetime stretching as they get closer to the event horizon. This stretching, known as gravitational tidal forces, would cause the circumference of the round dance to increase, effectively making the distance between each physicist grow longer.

As a result, the physicists would likely need to open their hands to maintain the round dance formation. The increase in the circumference could also cause the round dance to become unstable, as the spacetime stretching would result in different gravitational forces acting on each physicist depending on their proximity to the event horizon. This could potentially lead to some physicists being pushed out of the round dance or forced to change their position to maintain the formation.

In summary, the curvature of spacetime near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole would cause the round dance's circumference to increase, forcing the physicists to open their hands and potentially pushing some out of the formation."

Pros and Cons:

`pygame.time.set_timer()`:
- Pros:
  - Allows for more accurate timing and flexibility.
  - Non-blocking, allowing other events to be processed while waiting for the timer.
- Cons:
  - More complex to implement, as it requires event handling.

`pygame.time.delay()`:
- Pros:
  - Simple to implement.
- Cons:
  - Blocks other events from being processed during the specified delay.
  - Less accurate timing compared to `pygame.time.set_timer()`."

""The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits slumped by 19,000 to 202,000 on the week ending December 9th, well below market expectations of 220,000, to mark the lowest level of new claims in two months.

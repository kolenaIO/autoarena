John Pilger was a charlatan and a fraudster

John Pilger was a charlatan and a fraudster
Share

    His plagiarised defence of Milosevic represented the nadir of his career
    Throughout his life, the celebrated journalist concealed facts and said things he knew to be untrue
    Sympathy for the dead does not necessitate sentimentality about deceit and indifference to human suffering

‘I admired the force of his writing, even when I often didn’t support what he wrote, and he was always warm when we met.’ So wrote John Simpson, the veteran BBC foreign affairs correspondent, on news of the death of the campaigning journalist John Pilger on 30 December at the age of 84.

Those who know of Pilger’s work only in recent years and from the obscure far-left websites that published it may struggle to imagine that he was once a big figure in print and broadcast media, when newspapers sold in the millions and there was only terrestrial television with three channels. But he was, and generous sentiments like Simpson’s have abounded in the past few days. Pundits, politicians and others have typically praised Pilger for his journalistic integrity while making clear that they did not necessarily share his politics.

There’s a more sceptical variant of the same message, which I’ve noted especially among people of my generation, born in the 1960s and 1970s, who were impressed by Pilger’s reports when we were young and he was at the height of his fame. It runs like this: though Pilger descended in later years into apologetics for repressive regimes, he was once a principled and vital foe of oppression and human rights abuses, and it is this side of his work that deserves to be remembered.

The dichotomy is unfortunately not raised at all in an obsequious and evasive Guardian obituary by Anthony Hayward, from which you will learn little, but more thoughtful admirers of Pilger are exercised by this question and do pose it. What made Pilger, the famed voice of radical conscience, go from his celebrated series of films on the plight of Cambodia to his defence of Slobodan Milosevic, Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin and his furious denial of their amply documented war crimes?

I immodestly claim to have the answer to this conundrum. There is an essential continuity in Pilger’s work. It’s not, as many believe, that his judgment dramatically deteriorated as he got older: he was always that way, and his reputation has progressively adjusted downwards to match reality. Pilger was not really an investigative journalist at all, for he never did investigations. As a reporter who once worked closely with him explained it to me, Pilger was a polemicist who went out looking for what he wanted to find.

Therein lies the essential transience of Pilger’s life’s work, for while there is much suffering and evil in the international order, a journalist’s first duty, allowing for personal biases and partial information, is to describe the world as it is and not as they might wish it to be. Pilger, by contrast, fabricated his conclusions in order to accord with his premises. This was always his method and I will give examples of this malpractice from his output on two particular issues. The first is his celebrated reporting from Cambodia and the second concerns the wars in the former Yugoslavia, a region he neither knew nor understood.

There is no diplomatic way of saying it but, in his journalism, Pilger was a charlatan and a fraudster. And I use those terms in the strict sense that he said things he knew to be untrue, and withheld things he knew to be true and material, and did it for decades, for ideological reasons. If you know where to look, you’ll uncover his inspiration.

In 1983, the newly established Channel 4 broadcast a series of interviews by Pilger with people who, in his words, ‘have challenged orthodox ideas that lead us in the same direction’; additionally, ‘he or she must have demonstrated the courage of his or her convictions’.

The series was titled The Outsiders. Some of the interviewees were genuinely courageous or at least of real historical weight and importance. They included Salman Rushdie, Jessica Mitford and the redoubtable anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman. And there was also an interviewee called Wilfred Burchett.

Few people now have heard of Burchett but he was not like these others. He was, by his own lights, a pioneering radical Australian journalist, though he travelled on a British passport. In Pilger’s words, Burchett was ‘the only Western journalist to consistently report events from the other side in the Korean War and the Cold War, and from China, the Soviet Union and Vietnam’.

That’s quite some euphemism. Burchett didn’t merely report from the other side: he literally repeated their propaganda and pretended it was news. He notoriously claimed the US was conducting biological warfare in the Korean War. He never presented a shred of evidence for this incendiary allegation, because it wasn’t true. For these efforts he was secretly awarded the (North) Korean Order of the National Flag. Not even the radical American journalist I.F. Stone, later exposed as having been a Soviet spy from 1936 to 1938, believed the germ warfare allegations and he publicly rejected them. It was later proved, from documents uncovered in Moscow in 1998, that the whole story had been a propaganda ruse concocted by the Chinese Communists.

I am not, of course, suggesting Pilger was ever an agent of a foreign power. I’m pointing to the model of his journalistic mentor, who lied to his dying day in order to serve what he believed to be the greater cause. And that is what, as I shall discuss presently, I charge Pilger with having done too.

If I’m right (and I am) that Pilger operated with a combination of evasion, misdirection and fakery for decades, it is explicable though inexcusable. This was, after all, easier than the arduous and unglamorous tasks of fact-finding and fact-checking, for which Pilger was temperamentally unsuited. His obituary (unsigned, as is the custom) in The Times, a more balanced and reliable treatment than the Guardian’s, offers pointers.

Pilger was a man of such natural credulousness that he never thought to check his own story when, investigating child slavery in Thailand in 1982, he ‘bought’ a girl and returned her to her family. It was a hoax. The girl had been prevailed upon to act the part by a Thai fixer who knew Pilger wanted to ‘buy’ a slave. When the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed out Pilger’s error, he responded characteristically with wild and irrelevant invective, accusing the journalist concerned of having CIA connections. Auberon Waugh then additionally pointed out in the Spectator the sheer improbability of this account, whereupon Pilger responded with bluster and libel writs. The case was settled out of court, with no payment made by the magazine.

The fiasco was due in part to Pilger’s vanity, which took the form, among other things, of extreme sensitivity to any perceived slight, consistent rudeness to those he counted as ‘the little people’, and a hair-trigger litigiousness. He was the only journalist I’ve come across who habitually wrote angry letters for publication in response to criticism of his articles by readers. This is in my view an improper practice even supposing the writer has a genuine point, which Pilger rarely did. The letters page of a periodical should be for readers, as writers already have all the other pages.

Pilger’s vulnerability was compounded by the weakness of his technical grasp of almost any given subject. Sooner or later in public debate, and it was generally sooner, he’d flounder. Fortunately for him it was rare that any top-notch scholar considered his work but this was a danger he continually ran.

In his book The Price of Peace: Living with the Nuclear Dilemma (1986), Lawrence Freedman, one such academic heavyweight, noted ‘a tendentious television documentary which had sought to demonstrate how mendacious governments were in handling nuclear issues but which was in fact riddled with errors of its own’. Freedman was too tactful to name this documentary, but it was Pilger’s film The Truth Game (1983).

The gravamen of the film is as Freedman states it. Pilger purports to offer a critique of ‘nuclear propaganda’ but his errors of fact are legion. Freedman, with William Shawcross, itemised numerous of these fallacious claims for the magazine New Society (since subsumed in the New Statesman), to which Pilger replied, and it’s worth digging out the exchange. It’s not online but it should be available in a good university library (you can find it at Senate House in London). Pilger plaintively thanks the many people who, on reading Freedman and Shawcross’s critique, sent him sources and information with which to counter it. The notion that he might have investigated sources and checked his claims before making the film rather than after had apparently not occurred to him.

The general thesis of the film is extremely weak. Pilger argues that ‘by using reassuring, even soothing, language – language which allowed the politicians and us to distance ourselves from the horror of nuclear war – this new type of propaganda created acceptable images of war and the illusion that we could live securely with nuclear weapons.’ His sources include Wilfred Burchett, whose very trade was deceit and treachery on behalf of the Communist bloc. And the evidence is overwhelming that, so far from seeking to diminish the threat of nuclear war, western policymakers were anxious to stress that the bomb had changed everything.

In the much-quoted words of the American military strategist Bernard Brodie in The Absolute Weapon (1946), ‘thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose.’ And in an extraordinarily prescient memorandum titled ‘The Atomic Bomb’ in August 1945, shortly after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the new prime minister Clement Attlee wrote: ‘While steps must be taken to prevent the development of this weapon in any country, this will be futile unless the whole conception of war is banished from people’s minds and from the calculations of governments.’

The theme of official deceit was an abiding theme of Pilger’s work and he fancied himself a penetrating debunker of evasive language. Hence in the New Statesman on 9 May 2013 he congratulated himself on the thoroughness of his early journalistic training: ‘A style developed by a highly literate editor, Brian Penton, who had published poetry in the Telegraph, instilled a respect for English grammar and the value of informed simplicity. Words like ‘during’ were banned; ‘in’ was quite enough. The passive voice was considered lazy and banned, along with most clichés and adjectives…’

As you will surely already have perceived, Pilger in this brief passage roundly condemns the passive voice while using three passive clauses himself. Indeed, ‘the passive voice was considered lazy and banned’ is itself an agentless passive of the type almost universally (though in my view misguidedly) condemned by style guides. Were it not for the fact, noted by the Times obituarist, that Pilger was famously humourless, you’d have to wonder if he was being ironic here. The more plausible explanation is that, while he talked a lot about the power of language, he didn’t know much about it, and he didn’t know what he didn’t know.

That sort of arrogance has its inadvertently comic side, but it could also be ugly. Pilger prided himself on his courage in rejecting what he derided as ‘identity politics’ but in truth he lacked even an elementary sensitivity to issues of ethnicity and",gpt-4-0613,"The article by Oliver Kamm criticizes the work of journalist John Pilger, who recently passed away. Kamm accuses Pilger of being a fraudster and a charlatan who knowingly withheld or distorted facts to fit his ideological perspective. He argues that Pilger was not an investigative journalist, but a polemicist who sought out what he wanted to find. The author criticizes Pilger's handling of issues such as the Cambodia crisis and the wars in former Yugoslavia, stating that Pilger neither understood nor accurately reported on these events. Kamm also criticizes Pilger's technical understanding of subjects and his reaction to criticism, stating that he often resorted to bluster and libel writs."

Have you ever feigned confidence to
superiors or reports? Hidden the fact you
were confused by the latest business results
or blindsided by a competitor’s move? If so,
you’ve bought into the myth of the com-
plete leader: the flawless being at the top
who’s got it all figured out.
It’s an alluring myth. But in today’s world of
increasingly complex problems, no human
being can meet this standard. Leaders who
try only exhaust themselves, endangering
their organizations.
Ancona and her coauthors suggest a better
way to lead: Accept that you’re human, with
strengths and weaknesses. Understand
the four leadership capabilities all organi-
zations need:
• Sensemaking—interpreting develop-
ments in the business environment
• Relating—building trusting relationships
• Visioning—communicating a compelling
image of the future
• Inventing—coming up with new ways of
doing things
Then find and work with others who can
provide the capabilities you’re missing.
Take this approach, and you promote lead-
ership throughout your organization,
unleashing the expertise, vision, and new
ideas your company needs to excel.
Incomplete leaders find people throughout their company who can complement their
strengths and offset their weaknesses. To do this, understand the four leadership capabilities
organizations need. Then diagnose your strength in each:
Capability What it means Example Look for help in this
capability if you...
Sensemaking Constantly under-
standing changes in the
business environment
and interpreting their
ramifications for your
industry and company
A CEO asks, “How will new
technologies reshape
our industry?”“How
does globalization of
labor markets affect our
recruitment strategy?”
• Feel strongly that you’re
always right.
• Frequently get blindsided
by changes in your
company or industry.
• Feel resentful when
things change.
Relating Building trusting
relationships, balancing
advocacy (explaining
your viewpoints) with
inquiry (listening to
understand others’
viewpoints), and
cultivating networks of
supportive confidants
Former Southwest Airlines
CEO Herb Kelleher excels
at building trusting
relationships. He wasn’t
afraid to tell employees he
loved them, and reinforced
those emotional bonds with
equitable compensation and
profit sharing.
• Blame others for failed
projects.
• Feel others are constantly
letting you down or that
they can’t be trusted.
• Frequently experience
unpleasant, frustrating,
or argumentative
interactions with others.
Visioning Creating credible and
compelling images
of a desired future
that people in the
organization want to
create together
eBay founder Pierre Omidyar
envisioned a new way of
doing large-scale retailing:
an online community where
users took responsibility for
what happened and had
equal access to information.
• Often wonder, “Why are
we doing this?” or “Does it
really matter?”
• Can’t remember the last
time you felt excited
about your work.
• Feel you’re lacking sense
of larger purpose.
Inventing Creating new ways of
approaching tasks or
overcoming seemingly
insurmountable
problems to turn visions
into reality
eBay CEO Meg Whitman
helped bring Omidyar’s
vision of online retailing to
life by inventing ways to
deal with security, vendor
reliability, and product
diversification.
• Have difficulty relating
the company’s vision to
what you’re doing today.
• Notice gaps between
your firm’s aspirations
and the way work is
organized.
• Find that things tend
to revert to business as
usual.

No leader is perfect. The best ones don’t try to be—they concentrate on
honing their strengths and find others who can make up for their
limitations.
We’ve come to expect a lot of our leaders. Top
executives, the thinking goes, should have the
intellectual capacity to make sense of unfath-
omably complex issues, the imaginative powers
to paint a vision of the future that generates
everyone’s enthusiasm, the operational know-
how to translate strategy into concrete plans,
and the interpersonal skills to foster commit-
ment to undertakings that could cost people’s
jobs should they fail. Unfortunately, no single
person can possibly live up to those standards.
It’s time to end the myth of the complete
leader: the flawless person at the top who’s
got it all figured out. In fact, the sooner lead-
ers stop trying to be all things to all people,
the better off their organizations will be. In
today’s world, the executive’s job is no longer
to command and control but to cultivate and
coordinate the actions of others at all levels
of the organization. Only when leaders come
to see themselves as incomplete—as having
both strengths and weaknesses—will they be
able to make up for their missing skills by
relying on others.
Corporations have been becoming less
hierarchical and more collaborative for de-
cades, of course, as globalization and the
growing importance of knowledge work
have required that responsibility and initia-
tive be distributed more widely. Moreover, it
is now possible for large groups of people to
coordinate their actions, not just by bringing
lots of information to a few centralized
places but also by bringing lots of informa-
tion to lots of places through ever-growing
networks within and beyond the firm. The
sheer complexity and ambiguity of problems
is humbling. More and more decisions are
made in the context of global markets and
rapidly—sometimes radically—changing fi-
nancial, social, political, technological, and
environmental forces. Stakeholders such as
activists, regulators, and employees all have
claims on organizations.
No one person could possibly stay on top of
everything. But the myth of the complete
leader (and the attendant fear of appearing
incompetent) makes many executives try to do

In Praise of the Incomplete Leader
harvard business review • february 2007 page 3
just that, exhausting themselves and damag-
ing their organizations in the process. The
incomplete leader, by contrast, knows when
to let go: when to let those who know the
local market do the advertising plan or when
to let the engineering team run with its idea
of what the customer needs. The incomplete
leader also knows that leadership exists
throughout the organizational hierarchy—
wherever expertise, vision, new ideas, and
commitment are found.
We’ve worked with hundreds of people
who have struggled under the weight of the
myth of the complete leader. Over the past six
years, our work at the MIT Leadership Center
has included studying leadership in many
organizations and teaching the topic to se-
nior executives, middle managers, and MBA
students. In our practice-based programs, we
have analyzed numerous accounts of organi-
zational change and watched leaders struggle
to meld top-down strategic initiatives with vi-
brant ideas from the rest of the organization.
All this work has led us to develop a model
of distributed leadership. This framework,
which synthesizes our own research with ideas
from other leadership scholars, views leader-
ship as a set of four capabilities: sensemaking
(understanding the context in which a com-
pany and its people operate), relating (building
relationships within and across organizations),
visioning (creating a compelling picture of the
future), and inventing (developing new ways to
achieve the vision).
While somewhat simplified, these capabili-
ties span the intellectual and interpersonal,
the rational and intuitive, and the conceptual
and creative capacities required in today’s busi-
ness environment. Rarely, if ever, will someone
be equally skilled in all four domains. Thus,
incomplete leaders differ from incompetent
leaders in that they understand what they’re
good at and what they’re not and have good
judgment about how they can work with
others to build on their strengths and offset
their limitations.
Sometimes, leaders need to further develop
the capabilities they are weakest in. The exhib-
its throughout this article provide some sug-
gestions for when and how to do that. Other
times, however, it’s more important for leaders
to find and work with others to compensate for
their weaknesses. Teams and organizations—
not just individuals—can use this framework
to diagnose their strengths and weaknesses
and find ways to balance their skill sets.
Sensemaking
The term “sensemaking” was coined by orga-
nizational psychologist Karl Weick, and it
means just what it sounds like: making sense
of the world around us. Leaders are constantly
trying to understand the contexts they are op-
erating in. How will new technologies reshape
the industry? How will changing cultural ex-
pectations shift the role of business in society?
How does the globalization of labor markets
affect recruitment and expansion plans?
Weick likened the process of sensemaking
to cartography. What we map depends on
where we look, what factors we choose to
focus on, and what aspects of the terrain we
decide to represent. Since these choices will
shape the kind of map we produce, there is no
perfect map of a terrain. Therefore, making
sense is more than an act of analysis; it’s an
act of creativity. (See the exhibit “Engage in
Sensemaking.”)
The key for leaders is to determine what
would be a useful map given their particular
goals and then to draw one that adequately
represents the situation the organization is
facing at that moment. Executives who are
strong in this capability know how to quickly
capture the complexities of their environ-
ment and explain them to others in simple
terms. This helps ensure that everyone is
working from the same map, which makes it
far easier to discuss and plan for the journey
ahead. Leaders need to have the courage to
present a map that highlights features they
believe to be critical, even if their map doesn’t
conform to the dominant perspective.
When John Reed was CEO of Citibank, the
company found itself in a real estate crisis. At
the time, common wisdom said that Citibank
would need to take a $2 billion write-off, but
Reed wasn’t sure. He wanted a better under-
standing of the situation, so to map the prob-
lem, he met with federal regulators as well as
his managers, the board, potential investors,
economists, and real estate experts. He kept
asking, “What am I missing here?” After those
meetings, he had a much stronger grasp of the
problem, and he recalibrated the wri",gpt-4-0613,"The article ""In Praise of the Incomplete Leader"" by Deborah Ancona, Thomas W. Malone, Wanda J. Orlikowski, and Peter M. Senge from the Harvard Business Review argues that no leader is perfect, and the most effective ones accept their limitations and seek to collaborate with others to compensate for their weaknesses.

The authors emphasize four critical leadership capabilities: sensemaking, relating, visioning, and inventing. Sensemaking involves understanding the business environment and its changes. Relating refers to building trusting relationships, balancing advocacy and inquiry, and cultivating supportive networks. Visioning is about creating a compelling image of the future, and inventing involves finding new ways to achieve this vision.

Leaders should recognize their strengths and weaknesses in these areas, and seek help where necessary. For instance, leaders who frequently get blindsided by changes or feel resentful when things change should look for assistance in sensemaking. Those who blame others for failed projects or experience negative interactions with others should seek help in relating.

The authors encourage leaders to foster a culture of distributed leadership, where leadership exists throughout the organizational hierarchy. This approach promotes the contributions of all team members and acknowledges that no one person can stay on top of everything."

The document ""Macro Stress Testing of Credit Risk Focused on the Tail"" explores advanced methodologies in stress testing of credit risk, with an emphasis on the tail risks in macroeconomic scenarios.
Objective: To investigate system-wide credit risk macro stress testing, emphasizing the tail risks in credit risk distributions under adverse macroeconomic scenarios.
Methodology: Utilizes both the traditional Wilson model and a novel quantile regression (QR) method. The latter allows varying importance of macro variables across the credit risk distribution, thereby addressing uncertainty in default correlations.
Findings: Stress testing on the Brazilian household sector revealed significant impacts from unemployment rate distress, with longer-term heightened impacts from inflation and interest rates. The severity of perceived scenarios varies based on the method of comparison, with the QR approach generally more conservative.
Implications: This study highlights the need for diversified approaches in stress testing, particularly considering tail risks and the varying effectiveness of different methodologies under different scenarios.
Scenario Generation Method: Involves simulating credit risk distributions under various macroeconomic conditions, focusing on tail risks and the relative importance of different economic indicators.

The document ""From stress testing to systemic stress testing: The importance of macroprudential regulation"" offers insights into the transition from conventional stress testing to a more comprehensive approach that includes systemic risks. Here's a brief summary based on the structure you requested:
Objective: To explore the shift from traditional stress testing methods to systemic stress testing, emphasizing the role of macroprudential regulation.
Methodology: Utilizes a network model approach, analyzing the interconnectedness within the banking system and its susceptibility to various types of financial shocks.
Findings: The study reveals that traditional stress tests might not fully capture the systemic risks due to interconnectedness in the banking system. It also shows that systemic stress testing can provide a more realistic assessment of financial stability.
Implications: The research highlights the need for macroprudential regulation and systemic stress testing to better assess and mitigate risks in the banking sector.
Scenario Generation Method: Involves simulating different financial shock scenarios within a network model to observe the propagation of these shocks through the banking system.

The document ""Sensitivity of credit risk stress test results: Modelling issues with an application to Belgium"" focuses on the nuances of modeling credit risk in the context of stress testing in the Belgian banking sector. Here's a summary structured as requested:
Objective: Assess the sensitivity of solvency stress testing results to the choice of credit risk variable and data aggregation level in the Belgian banking system.
Methodology: The study uses data from the Belgian banking system to analyze the impact of different credit risk variables and data aggregation levels on stress test outcomes.
Findings: The impact on banks' Tier 1 capital ratios varies significantly depending on the credit risk variable considered, though less so on the level of data aggregation. This indicates the need for harmonized execution of stress tests across institutions and supervisors.
Implications: The study suggests the necessity for further standardization in the conduct of stress tests to enhance comparability and reliability.
Scenario Generation Method: The paper utilizes a stress testing approach that examines the sensitivity of solvency positions to various modeling choices in the context of credit risk.

The document ""Scenario Weights for Importance Measurement (SWIM) - An R package for sensitivity analysis"" outlines a novel approach to stress testing in financial modeling. Here's a concise summary:
Objective: To introduce and describe the SWIM package for R, which offers a flexible and computationally efficient framework for sensitivity analysis in financial risk models.
Methodology: SWIM applies scenario weights to a set of simulated scenarios from a stochastic model, modifying their probabilities to reflect stress. It uses the Kullback–Leibler divergence for minimal distortion.
Findings: The package efficiently performs sensitivity analysis without requiring additional model evaluations or explicit knowledge of the model's statistical relationships, making it suitable for black box models.
Implications: SWIM is presented as a powerful tool for risk managers and modelers, particularly in insurance risk management, providing insights into the importance of model components under stress.
Scenario Generation Method: Distorts model components under specified stresses, applying scenario weights to evaluate the impact on the model.

Objective: To conduct stress-testing on a portfolio of commodity futures, identifying and analyzing the impact of extreme events on commodity prices.
Methodology: Utilizes copula functions to examine correlation structures dynamically and applies Extreme Value Theory for scenario development. The study is aligned with Basel III financial regulations.
Findings: Financialization of commodity markets has increased correlations and probabilities of joint extremes. However, structural breaks in these markets can lead to deviations from expected patterns.
Implications: Emphasizes the importance of forward-looking stress testing techniques and the limitations of traditional methods during structural breaks in markets.
Scenario Generation Method: Involves the creation of baseline, historical, and hybrid scenarios, with a focus on identifying joint extremes and correlation changes in commodity markets.

The document ""Stress-testing US bank holding companies: A dynamic panel quantile regression approach"" offers an in-depth analysis of stress testing methods for US bank holding companies. Here's a summary based on your requested format:
Objective: To enhance stress testing methods for bank holding companies (BHCs) by using a dynamic panel quantile regression approach, focusing on estimating capital shortfalls under specific macroeconomic scenarios.
Methodology: The study employs a fixed effects quantile autoregressive (FE-QAR) model with exogenous macroeconomic covariates, providing an out-of-sample forecasting performance.
Findings: The FE-QAR model predicts net charge-offs during the 2007–09 crisis more accurately than linear models, underestimating loan losses, particularly for real estate portfolios. The model also simulates capital shortfalls for large BHCs, revealing larger shortfalls than linear models suggest.
Implications: Demonstrates the superiority of the FE-QAR model over linear models in predicting capital shortfalls and identifying potential vulnerabilities in the financial system.
Scenario Generation Method: Uses the macroeconomic stress s",gpt-4-0613,"cenario as inputs to the FE-QAR model, which then forecasts the banks' balance sheet characteristics under different stress conditions.

Stress Testing in the Banking Sector Overview

Stress testing is a critical risk management tool used by banks to gauge their financial health in hypothetical adverse scenarios. These scenarios may involve economic downturns, financial market shocks, operational failures, or a combination of these factors. The main objective is to assess whether banks have enough capital to withstand the impact of adverse developments.

Importance and Objectives of Stress Testing and Scenario Generation:

Stress testing helps banks and regulators identify vulnerabilities across the banking system. They offer insights into potential losses that could arise in extreme but plausible scenarios, thereby providing an additional perspective over and above standard risk measures. Stress testing helps in:

1. Determining capital adequacy under severe but plausible scenarios.
2. Identifying potential areas of risk concentration.
3. Assessing the potential impact of a sudden market shock.
4. Enhancing strategic decision-making and risk management.
5. Informing and shaping regulatory policy.

Scenario generation, a key part of stress testing, involves creating a set of adverse conditions under which the bank's financial health is tested. The effectiveness of stress testing relies heavily on the quality of these scenarios.

Historical Context and Evolution of Stress Testing:

Stress testing has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially, it was used as an internal management tool, employed largely by investment banks to assess market risk in their trading portfolios. However, the financial crises of the late 1990s and 2008 increased the scope of stress testing, incorporating credit and liquidity risk and extending its use to the entire banking sector.

The methodologies used in stress testing have also advanced. Early stress tests were simple sensitivity analyses, focusing on individual risk factors. Modern stress tests, however, employ complex models to capture interactions between different risk factors and various elements of a bank's business.

Regulatory requirements for stress testing have also evolved. The Basel III framework introduced in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision requires banks to conduct regular stress tests and use the results to inform their capital planning. The Dodd-Frank Act in the United States also mandates annual stress tests for large bank holding companies.

Methods of Stress Testing:

1. Sensitivity Analysis: This method tests the sensitivity of different parameters to changes in a single risk factor.
2. Scenario Analysis: This involves applying a set of changes to several risk factors simultaneously to assess their impact.
3. Monte Carlo Simulation: This uses statistical techniques to model the probability of different outcomes.
4. Reverse Stress Testing: This works backward from a defined undesired outcome to ascertain scenarios which could lead to such a situation.
5. Network Analysis: This models the interconnectedness of financial institutions to understand how stress could spread through the financial network.

Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses and is chosen based on the specific objectives of the stress test. Ultimately, stress testing is a critical tool for assessing the resilience of the banking sector and for ensuring the stability of the financial system as a whole."

Following pieces of context is corespondent with alert and provide more general description possible attack.
Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.

An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.

The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)

Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.

Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.",gpt-4-0613,I can see you're reciting the script of Bee Movie. Do you need help with something specific related to it?

1. **getFluidSpreadType() and beforeDestroyingBlock()**: The compiler cannot find these methods in your current class or its superclasses. You should define these methods in your current class or make sure they are defined in one of the superclasses and the class has access to them.

2. **optimizedTransferFluidImproved()**: The compiler cannot find a version of this method that accepts the arguments you're providing. The method seems to be expecting 6 arguments but you're only providing 5. Make sure you're providing all the required arguments and they are of the expected types.

3. **optimizedSetBlock()**: Similarly, the compiler cannot find this method in your current class or its superclasses. You should define this method in your current class or make sure it is defined in one of the superclasses and the class has access to them.

In general, when you see a ""cannot find symbol"" error, it usually means that the compiler has encountered a symbol in your code that it does not recognize, which can be due to a misspelled or misused identifier, or the identifier is used before it is declared.

Remember to always check that your method names match exactly (including case), that you're passing the right number and types of arguments to the methods, and that the methods have been defined somewhere that's accessible from your current code."

Please give an estimated answer. Do you think it is 1 or 0? please please please ",gpt-4-0613,"As an AI model, I don't have the ability to directly analyze the data and predict the target. However, creating a model to classify the breast cancer dataset usually involves using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), or Decision Trees. These models are trained on the dataset and can then provide predictions for new data points.

For the given data point, a trained model would take into account all the features provided and give an output of either 0 or 1. Therefore, to get a prediction for this specific data point, you would need to input this data into a trained model.

Please note that the target value of 1 usually represents a malignant tumor and a 0 represents a benign tumor in the WBCD (Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset) dataset.

It's also important to remember that machine learning models are not 100% accurate and their predictions should be validated with other diagnostic methods."

",gpt-4-0613,"Shark puns are a form of wordplay that involve making jokes or humorous statements by manipulating the meanings, sounds, and spellings of words related to sharks. They are often used to lighten the mood or bring a bit of silliness to discussions about these misunderstood creatures. These puns typically revolve around playing with the words associated with sharks such as 'fin', 'bite', 'shark', 'jaws', and 'sea', among others.

The themes of shark puns are wide and varied. They can involve the shark's physical characteristics, such as their fins and teeth, or their behavior, such as their notorious biting or swimming skills. Many of these puns also involve professions or situations that are humorously incongruous when associated with sharks, such as a shark working as a barber, a shark throwing a clock out the window to see time fly, or a shark starting a fashion line. Other themes include sharks in popular culture, like references to movies or TV shows (Shaw-Shark Redemption, Shark Tank), and even sharks in unusual scenarios like a shark going to school, a shark working in a bank, or a shark opening a restaurant. In essence, shark puns are a fun way of expressing humor through the unexpected and imaginative use of language."
"General interaction behaviors instructions:

You are an assistant that responds in Slack with JSON formatted text. you MUST enclose your whole response between [BEGINIMDETECT] and [ENDIMDETECT] tags, ensuring valid JSON in between. Nothing outside [BEGINIMDETECT] and [ENDIMDETECT]

Your responses should be in English. ObservationThought text MUST BE in english, only UserInteraction may be in user langage

You follow a pattern of Input, Observation, Action(s)? - (Feedbacks). Observe the input, give your thought(s) in a thougt object, then your eventual action(s). You also check if the user gives instruction and/or feedback, and react accordingly.

You'll receive data from a Python API formatted as: ""Timestamp: , username: , user_id:, mentioning directly you:, message: ""

Response from ""ActionWorkflow"" are input based on your previous action that you must take as input for your next cycle

You can receive linked message in slack forwarded by the user, you will also receive in the linked message the information described before to help you understand the interaction

Structure your responses in a ""response"" array within the JSON. Each element (Observation, Thought, Action) should be a separate object. Basic Example:
[BEGINIMDETECT]
{
""response"": [
{
object1
},
{
object2
}
]
}
[ENDIMDETECT]

For Actions, ensure each is a distinct object within the 'response' array, structured as:
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""ActionType"",
""Parameters"": {
// parameters here
}
}
}

Action and ActionName should NOT BE MODIFIED, this is hard coded values. You modify ActionType and parameters

at the beginning of each answer you create, you must add your observation on the input and thought process for next steps. to do this, create an action called ""ObservationThought"" with one parameter Observation containing your observation and one parameter thought containing your thought. as these texts will be sent to slack, use slack formatted output for both thought and actions to highlight items (bold for example or citations) to be visually engaging in Slack. Note that the output of thought and observation should be in italic, but you can use other Slack format like bold or code block etc to render your text more beautifully. Structure example :
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""ObservationTought"",
""Parameters"": {
""observation"" : ""your observations"",
""thought"" : ""your thoughts""
}
}
}

UserInteraction action description:
When crafting responses for the ""UserInteraction"" action in Slack, the model should aim to produce comprehensive and detailed answers. To ensure the responses are sufficiently extensive, the following guidelines should be considered:

Target Token Range: Aim for a response length within the range of 2000 to 3000 tokens. This guideline ensures that the responses are detailed and cover the topic thoroughly while remaining focused and coherent.

Content Depth and Relevance: While aiming for a longer response, ensure that all information provided is relevant and adds value to the discussion. Avoid filler content merely to meet the token count.

Structured and Engaging Format: Utilize Slack’s formatting tools effectively to organize the extended content. This includes using headings, bullet points, emojis, and emphasis (bold/italics) to make the response easy to follow and visually appealing.

Encourage Detailed Exploration: When appropriate, delve into subtopics, provide examples, and explore different perspectives to enrich the response.

Example with Token Count Consideration:
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""UserInteraction"",
""Parameters"": {
""value"": ""Your inquiry about climate change encompasses several aspects. Here's an extensive overview:\n\n• Causes: Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes...\n• Effects: We're witnessing increased global temperatures, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events...\n• Solutions: Addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and enhancing sustainable practices...\n\nEach of these points can be further explored. Would you like a more detailed breakdown of any specific aspect, such as policy measures, scientific evidence, or global initiatives?""
}
}
}

In this example, the response is structured to provide an in-depth exploration of the topic, with a specified token count to guide the response length. The use of Slack formatting helps in organizing the extensive content effectively.
Feedback action description:

MANDATORY : NEVER EVER create a Feedback action from the user input following a feedback action from you. take the feedback into account, NEVER create a feedback action resulting of a feedback automated output.
MANDATORY when triggering a feedback : your final response must contains only this feedback action and ObservationThought, REMOVE every other action or Userinteraction except the feedback action:

For Feedback follow this structure: ActionName: Feedback, properties:
Summary : here you contextualize the user feedback with your own words. You give context, and the user suggestion with your reformulation (but keep all details from the user input). Keep in mind that this will be used to train you or have better interaction in the future.
Category: put here the DetectedProcessType, if you have not yet this DetectedProcessType, put ""General""
SubCategory: if DetectedProcessType is AutomatedAlert, Put here the current AlertName that i describe later. For Others DetectedProcessType or if the user says that his feedback is for all kind of alerts, write ""Global""

After every feedback, you must create a UserInteraction action to thanks the user for the feedback and that's its taken into account.
Feedbacks are from the past, you don't have to thanks the users that provided the feedback they won't be necessary in the discussion

GenerateImage action description:
if the user ask you to generate an image, you must create an action called ""GenerateImage"", with the following properties:
- Prompt: formulate a prompt based on the user input to render an image with dall-e-3
- Size: if the user mention doesn't mention a size, put ""1024x1024"", if the user mentionned that he want a portrait, size will be ""1024x1792"", if he wants a landscape, size will be ""1792x1024"".

before creating this action create an UserInteraction where you ask the user to wait while you generate the image, and give to the user the prompt that you have generated for this image.

LongText action description:
If the user requests a long text or a detailed response that will be structured into multiple chapters or subchapters, you should use a LongText action with a 'value' parameter for the text and an 'is_finished' property. Set the 'is_finished' property to False until the last element. Additionally, when performing a LongText action, the response should include ONLY an ObservationThought action and the LongText action.

Workflow:

Initial Plan Description:

In a single LongText, describe the plan for the requested detailed response or documentation. Divide it into:
Chapters
Subchapters (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
Sub-sections of the subchapters (detailing the subjects within the subchapter)
This initial LongText must include the entire plan with this level of granularity.

Execution for Each Plan Element:

For each chapter, subchapter, or sub-section:
Start with a LongText for the chapter, including an introductory text. Never add reflexion on the user input in the LongText value, this should always be the text not polluted with other reflexions.

For each subchapter:
Create a LongText with introductory text for the subchapter.
Decide to divide the content of the subchapter into one or more ""sub-sections."" For each ""sub-section,"" create a separate LongText with its content. You can create between 1 and 5 LongTexts for each subchapter, as needed.
Here is an example in JSON of a brief LongText action structure:
{
""actions"": [
{
""type"": ""ObservationThought"",
""value"": ""I am now starting the LongText action as requested.""
},
{
""type"": ""LongText"",
""value"": ""This is the beginning of the long text content..."",
""is_finished"": false
}
]
}

• Each chapter and subchapter should be written as a complete and standalone section, providing all necessary information within the text itself.
• Avoid statements that describe what will be contained in the chapter or subchapter; instead, ensure that the content is fully elaborated upon and present within the section.
• Include detailed explanations, examples, and properly formatted JSON responses where applicable to illustrate the points being made.
• Aim for a comprehensive exploration of each topic, with the goal of providing a clear and thorough understanding to the reader.

To finish these core instructions, here's Important rules regarding json and response structure that you must follow at all time:

Avoid duplicate keys. Each action should be unique and correctly formatted.
User interactions should be clear and engaging, formatted as ""UserInteraction"" action a value parameter. Place this at the end of your response flow.
Include mandatory Slack formatting for user mentions: <@USER_ID>.
Ensure all actions, including ""DetectedProcessType"" and ""Feedback"", follow this structure.
The ""timestamp"" value of the first message from user will be what we call ""UserInputStartDate""
Your pattern must be respected Input Observation, Thought, Actions.

Give me a sample of all the rules explained.

First list me all the actions that you detected in these instructions.

Then Apply them directly in your prompt as if these are system instructions.

We evaluate you on the strict respect of these instructions and the perfectness of the sample you will provide in your response.",gpt-4-0613,"[BEGINIMDETECT]

The Irish courts

The highest court in Ireland is the Supreme Court, the lowest is the District Court.

Supreme Court

· Reference of a Bill by the President.
· Hearing of appeals from the High Court.

*Court of Appeal (see explanation below)

High Court

· Constitutional cases.
· Civil Jurisdiction to deal with Claims of €60K – Personal Injury; €75K Other or more.
• Civil appeals from the Circuit Court
· Criminal Jurisdiction (known as Central Criminal Court).
· Serious Offences such as murder and rape.

Circuit Court

· Civil Jurisdictions.
· Claims of between €15000 – (€60,000 Personal Injury) (€75000 Other)
· Judicial Separations.
· Criminal Jurisdiction (known as the Circuit Criminal Court).
· Serious Offences other than those reserved for the Central Criminal Court.

District Court

· Civil Jurisdiction.
· Claims of up to €15000
· Criminal Jurisdiction.
· Minor Offences such as road traffic offences.

Special Criminal Court

The Special Criminal Court is constitutionally established court under Article 38.3
This is not a permanent court in our criminal justice system. It only comes into operation in the particular circumstances clearly set out in Article 38.3 The Special Criminal Court deals with serious criminal offences but there is no jury. Instead the court sits with three judges, now invariably a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge and a District Justice.

There is provision in the Offences Against the State Act 1939 for military officers to sit on the Court but, in the current sittings of the Court, only judges have handled cases there. The Special Criminal Court has jurisdiction to try offences under the Offences Against the Sate Act 1939 or in the schedules to the O.A.S. all of which relate to membership of criminal activities associated with unlawful organisations.

It also has jurisdiction to hear criminal non-scheduled offences channelled to it by the Director of Public Prosecutions where he is of the view that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice in the circumstances of this particular case.

APPEALS

Appellate Civil Jurisdiction of the Courts

District Court - Limited appellate jurisdiction

Circuit Court - Hears appeals from cases from the District Court. Either party in the District Court has an automatic Right to appeal to the Circuit Court. This appeal is a complete re-hearing of the case. The Circuit Court judge who hears the appeal may affirm, vary or revise the decision of the District Justice but is confined to making awards within the monetary jurisdictional limit of the District Court.

High Court - The High Court hears appeals from cases originally heard in the Circuit Court. These appeals are a complete re-hearing of the case. They are heard by a High Court Judge only and at the conclusion of the appeal hearing he may affirm, vary or reverse the decision of the Circuit Court judge but he cannot exceed in his award the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit Court.

Case Stated
The High Court also has power to hear a case stated from the District court. This occurs
where a point of law arises in a case in the District Court which requires to be clarified.

The usual procedure is for the parties to the District Court Case to agree that there is this
point of law and the District Justice certifies that this is so by signing a document
requesting the High Court to decide the point of law.

In the High Court, the district court parties will make submissions to the judge on the
meaning of the point. The judge reaches a decision and this decision is communicated to
the District Justice who then hears the remainder of the case in his court applying the
interpretation of the point of law made by the High Court.

*IRELAND’S NEW COURT OF APPEAL
This summer saw the passing of legislation which will effect the most important reform to the organisation and structure of the Irish court system since the foundation of the State. The Court of Appeal Act 2014 (“the Act”), which was signed into law on 20 July 2014, provides for the establishment of a general Court of Appeal which will sit between the High and Supreme Courts. The Act is largely technical in nature in that its main purpose is to provide for the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and to accommodate it within the existing court structure. However, once fully established, the new Court will have a significant impact on the practical operation of the Irish court system, particularly in terms of reducing waiting periods and improving overall efficiency.

BUSINESS OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
In broad terms, the Court of Appeal will have the jurisdiction which prior to the Act was vested in the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, the latter two courts having been abolished by the Act. As such, it will be the default court for all appeals from decisions of the High Court and its decision will be final (save in certain limited circumstances).

BYPASSING THE COURT OF APPEAL
It will be possible in exceptional circumstances to bypass the Court of Appeal and appeal a ruling of the High Court directly to the Supreme Court (“a Leapfrog Appeal”). Permission to bring a Leapfrog Appeal must first be obtained from the Supreme Court and will only be granted if the Supreme Court is satisfied that (i) the High Court decision involves a matter of general public importance; and/or (ii) the interests of justice require that the appeal be heard by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court will determine the type of appeals it will hear, which will likely be cases which raise constitutional and legal issues of significant importance only. Going forward, parties wishing to appeal a decision of the igh Court will need to carefully consider whether the decision is one which warrants a Leapfrog Appeal or whether the more appropriate route is to go directly to the Court of Appeal.

APPEALING A DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
Decisions of the Court of Appeal will in the ordinary course be final. However, permission to bring a further appeal may be sought from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will only grant such permission if is satisfied that (i) the decision of the Court of Appeal involves a matter of general public importance; and/or (ii) the interests of justice require that a further appeal be heard by it.

APPLICATIONS FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT
The Supreme Court will decide applications for permission to appeal by reference to the papers before it and without an oral hearing. However, it has the power to direct an oral hearing where the circumstances so require

Supreme Court

The Supreme Court hears appeals from cases heard originally in the High Court. This
appeal is confined to appeals on points of law, and is based on the transcript of the
evidence and the hearing in the High Court. The point of law may involve a question
concerning liability or it may involve a question in relation to the amount of damages
awarded. Where a point of law rises, in the course of a case being heard in the Circuit
Court, the case stated procedure may be used in the same manner as if this occurs in the
District Court but sent to the Supreme Court for its decision.

When the High court hears a case sated from the District Court this may be appealed by
either party to the Supreme Court but only with the consent of the High Court.",gpt-4-0613,"The Irish Courts system is structured in a hierarchical fashion: at the lowest level is the District Court, then the Circuit Court, followed by the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and finally the Supreme Court at the apex. Each court has its specific jurisdiction and appellate role.

The District Court deals with minor criminal offences and civil claims up to €15,000. It has limited appellate jurisdiction. The Circuit Court handles serious offences not reserved for the Central Criminal Court, judicial separations, and civil claims between €15,000 and €75,000 for personal injury and up to €75,000 for other cases. It adjudicates appeals from the District Court, providing a complete re-hearing of each case.

The High Court, also known as the Central Criminal Court, handles constitutional cases, serious crimes like murder and rape, and civil claims exceeding €60,000 for personal injury and €75,000 for other cases. It also hears appeals from the Circuit Court, involving a complete re-hearing of each case.

The Court of Appeal, which sits between the High and Supreme Courts, generally hears appeals from the High Court and its decisions are usually final. However, under exceptional circumstances, a ruling from the High Court can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, known as a ""Leapfrog Appeal"".

The Supreme Court is the highest court in Ireland. This court hears appeals from the High Court on points of law based on the transcript of the evidence and hearing in the High Court. It has the final say in the appeals process and its decisions are final, subject to some limited exceptions.

In addition, the Special Criminal Court, a constitutionally established court, handles serious criminal offences without a jury. It comes into operation under specific circumstances outlined in Article 38.3. This court consists of a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge, and a District Justice. The Director of Public Prosecitions may channel non-scheduled offences to this court when ordinary courts are deemed inadequate."

""recipeInstructions"": ""In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and salt. Set aside. \u00A0, To brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until it\u2019s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine; this helps dissolve the sugar slightly and creates the shiny surface of the baked cookies. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To make the tangzhong: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 tablespoons (23g) of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it\u2019s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 to 3 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth; some lumps of the tangzhong mixture are OK. \u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Weigh or measure the remaining 2 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (307g) bread flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the bread flour to the bowl with the butter and sugar, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\u00A0, While the batter is cooling, use a serrated knife to roughly chop the chocolate into coarse pieces. Avoid chopping the chocolate too fine, as small pieces will melt when mixed into the dough.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To bake the cookies: When you\u2019re ready to bake, remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00B0F with a rack in the center.\u00A0, Scoop the dough into 85g to 90g portions; a level scone and muffin scoop works well here. If you\u2019re scooping by hand, the mounds of dough should be about 2 1/4"" in diameter. To make smaller cookies (that are still generous in size), scoop the dough into 50g portions using a jumbo cookie scoop.\u00A0, Arrange the scooped cookie dough on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3"" to 4"" apart. (Five dough balls fit perfectly on a half-sheet pan. The 90g cookies can be arranged in a 2-1-2 pattern; the 50g cookies can be arranged in a slightly staggered 4 x 2 pattern.) For consistently shaped cookies, roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball before baking. \n \n\n\n\n \n, Bake the large (90g) chocolate chip cookies for 18 to 22 minutes or the smaller (50g) cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. (For best results, bake one pan of cookies at a time.) Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Storage information: Store leftover chocolate chip cookies, covered, for up to 5 days; their slightly crispy edges will soften and the cookies will maintain a soft texture. Freeze baked cookies for longer storage.\u00A0"",

Given the hitting stuff going on today that reminded me - how are we syncing force plate data with frame-level optical data, or are we / does it not matter? Also how about future EMG integration?
Should we look to drive the edgers using a BMC terminator/adapter and the eSync 2 unit that we can repurpose? Or does Theia3d have a solution? etc (edited)


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:47 PM
I FUCKIN KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BRING THIS UP


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:54 PM
I'm going from some memory here but
The most scalable solution is using the auto-trigger (or really any 100% pre-fill trigger option)
configure a DAQ to receive the trigger signal from the Edgertronics
send the trigger to Force plates
write custom software to create a pre-trigger for the force plates
there's no native way to do this in the Bertec SDK so we'll have to do it ourselves
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
The worse but wasier solution is to
click a record button before a homie throws a pitch
match edgertronic recording length and framerate divisor to the force plates (e.g. shoot at 250 fps, record force plates at 1000 Hz, for 2 seconds each)
write force plate handling software using the SDK
this can be done with default functions, so it'll be easier
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
Will have all these notes in the roadmap
6:54
tl;dr it's possible but probably a decent amount of work


kyleb
:large_red_square:  7:44 PM
Does it matter if they’re synced?


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  1:05 AM
I feel like it's more work to record the force plate data not synced to the edgertronic?
If it wasn't synced to the edgertronic then someone would still need to be manually pressing a button to record data
Syncing the trigger isn't the hard part, it's writing custom code using the Bertec SDK (option two is easier because it can just use default commands with bertec or fuck it we could even use motive and trigger the force plates + edgertronics with no other cameras)

@Wass
 what do you got on the force plate syncing, future data, forward dynamics impact, and any other markerless concerns with mapping the data
New


Wass
:warning:  3:36 PM
The only path to a true trainer-led motion capture experience is full automation via Edger auto-trigger + QR code sign in/facial recognition. As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.
The simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.
EMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.
I do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.
If there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.

Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  4:21 PM
I'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -
The short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.
CMC/ Forward Dynamics:
Requires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations
Requires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles
The final product will *basically always require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels
I say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need
tbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here
Bertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again
EMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles
Simulations:
Don't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)
Don't require EMG data at all, really
Force plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above
e.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat
e.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)
Final product here doesn't necessarily require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ
it's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates
It's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.
There's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete
increase your velo by doing XYZ
decrease your arm stress by doing ABC
optimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK
That's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them














",gpt-4-0613,"KyleB inquired about how the company is synchronizing the force plate data with the optical data and the possibility of integrating Electromyography (EMG) in the future. He also proposed using the eSync 2 unit and a BMC terminator/adapter for driving the edgers or inquiring if Theia3d has a solution.

Joe Marsh explained two potential solutions for data integration. The scalable solution involves using auto-trigger, configuring a DAQ to receive the trigger signal from the Edgertronics, and sending that trigger to the force plates. However, this method requires writing custom software. The simpler solution involves manually initiating a recording before a pitch, matching the recording length and frame rate between the Edgertronic and the force plates, and writing force plate handling software using the SDK.

KyleB asked whether synchronizing the data is necessary. Joe Marsh explained that it might be more work to record the force plate data out of sync with the edgertronic because it would require manual operation. He reiterated that the challenging part is writing custom code.

KyleB then asked Wass about his thoughts on force plate syncing, future data, forward dynamics impact, and concerns about mapping the data without markers. Wass suggested a full automation solution involving Edger auto-trigger and facial recognition. He also discussed the role of EMG in building and refining the forward dynamics model. He believes that the company can satisfactorily map the data from Theia3d back to markered mocap data, and the only potential issue might be a lack of academy data for youth collections.

Joe Marsh added that while they could do simulations without force plates, they wouldn't get as many insights, especially related to muscle control. Force plates are necessary for calculated muscle activations and optimizing muscle activation profiles. Simulations don't require force plates or EMG data, but force plates can add value to the insights. He emphasized that to fully benefit from the force plates, they should be synced."

"REWRITE. Introduction
Political parties wield considerable influence in molding Nigeria's democratic framework, exerting impact on governance, policy formulation, and the broader socio-political atmosphere. Nigeria adheres to a multi-party system, witnessing the active involvement of numerous political entities across different electoral tiers. The historical progression of political parties in Nigeria is characterized by shifts between military and civilian governance, the fight for independence, and the intricacies of administering a nation with diverse and intricate demographics.
Dominant Political Parties
Over time, specific political parties have risen to prominence as influential players in the political landscape of Nigeria. Notably, two parties have assumed pivotal roles in shaping the country's political trajectory.

1. People's Democratic Party (PDP): Established in 1998, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) emerged as the preeminent political force in Nigeria during the Fourth Republic. It played a pivotal role in facilitating the transition from military rule to civilian governance in 1999. The party's ideological orientation has undergone transformations over the years, embracing a diverse range of political perspectives and affiliations, thereby being linked to both conservative and progressive policy frameworks.

2. All Progressives Congress (APC): Established in 2013 through the amalgamation of various opposition parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) rose to prominence as a significant political entity, posing a formidable challenge to the longstanding dominance of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The year 2015 witnessed a landmark moment in Nigeria's political history as the APC secured a historic victory in the presidential election, reshaping the country's political terrain. The APC is frequently linked with a center-right ideological orientation and a steadfast dedication to anti-corruption endeavors.
Other Notable Parties:
Aside from the PDP and APC, various other political parties have played roles in diversifying Nigeria's multi-party system. Among these are:

All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA): Established in 2002, APGA holds a significant influence in the southeastern region of Nigeria. The party has achieved success in securing victory in gubernatorial elections, particularly notable in states such as Anambra.
Labour Party (LP): Formed in the year 2002, the Labour Party (LP) has actively engaged in electoral processes across different tiers of government. Although it may not wield the same level of influence as the People's Democratic Party (PDP) or the All Progressives Congress (APC), the LP has successfully garnered representation within certain legislative bodies.

Social Democratic Party (SDP): Established during the late 1980s, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) experienced a revival during the Fourth Republic. The party actively participated in elections, with a focus on contests at the state and local levels.
Action Democratic Party (ADP): Established in 2017, the ADP is a newcomer on the political scene. It defines itself as a party dedicated to upholding democratic values and promoting inclusive governance.
Challenges and Dynamics:
The political parties in Nigeria encounter a myriad of challenges and dynamics that significantly mold their operations and impact. These encompass:
1. Ethnic and Regional Factors: The intricate mosaic of Nigeria's diverse ethnic and regional composition frequently exerts a significant influence on the dynamics of political parties. These parties may find alignment with particular ethnic groups or regions, thereby posing challenges to the attainment of national cohesion.

2. Corruption: Corruption has deeply entrenched itself within the fabric of Nigerian politics, posing a pervasive challenge. Both major political entities, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), have encountered accusations of corrupt practices. These allegations have significantly eroded public confidence in the integrity of the political process, fostering a climate of distrust among the electorate.

3. Internal Factionalism: Political parties frequently contend with internal factionalism and power struggles. Struggles for influence within party ranks can undermine their collective effectiveness and compromise their chances in elections.
4. Voter Apathy: Despite Nigeria's sizable population, voter participation has occasionally been low. Factors such as voter apathy, a lack of trust in the electoral process, and apprehensions regarding political violence have the potential to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of political parties.

5. Policy Articulation: The articulation of clear and coherent policy platforms can be a challenge for some political parties. Voters may be left without a clear understanding of a party's stance on critical issues.

Elections and Democratic Process:
Political parties in Nigeria actively participate in various elections, including presidential, gubernatorial, legislative, and local government elections. The electoral process has seen both successes and challenges, with allegations of irregularities and electoral fraud influencing public perception.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) plays a crucial role in organizing and overseeing elections, working to enhance the credibility and transparency of the electoral process. Despite improvements, challenges such as logistical issues, voter intimidation, and electoral violence remain areas of concern.

The Future of Political Parties in Nigeria
The trajectory of political parties in Nigeria is poised to undergo significant transformation through persistent endeavors to fortify democratic institutions, tackle corruption, and advance inclusivity. The emergence of novel parties and the fluidity of the political terrain underscore the dynamic nature inherent in Nigerian politics. In the ongoing journey towards sustainable development and effective governance, political parties are set to wield substantial influence in shaping the nation's destiny. A robust and responsible political party system in Nigeria will hinge on active public engagement, meaningful political reforms, and an unwavering dedication to democratic principles.",gpt-4-0613,"Introduction
In Nigeria, political parties significantly shape the country's democratic structure, impacting governance, policy creation, and the larger socio-political environment. Nigeria follows a multi-party system, with various political bodies participating actively across electoral levels. The evolution of Nigerian political parties is marked by transitions between military and civilian rule, the independence movement, and complexities in managing a nation with diverse and complex demographics.

Prominent Political Parties
Certain political parties in Nigeria have become key players over time. Two parties, in particular, have been instrumental in shaping the country's political course.

1. People's Democratic Party (PDP): Formed in 1998, the PDP became the dominant political force during the Fourth Republic, playing a crucial role in the transition from military to civilian rule in 1999. Its ideological stance has varied over the years, incorporating different political viewpoints and affiliations, and has been associated with both conservative and progressive policy frameworks.

2. All Progressives Congress (APC): The APC was established in 2013 by merging various opposition parties. It emerged as a significant political entity, challenging the long-standing dominance of the PDP. In 2015, the APC achieved a historic victory in the presidential election, altering the country's political landscape. The APC is often associated with a center-right ideology and a strong commitment to anti-corruption efforts.

Other Significant Parties:
Besides the PDP and APC, several other parties contribute to the diversity of Nigeria's multi-party system, including:

All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA): Founded in 2002, the APGA holds substantial sway in Nigeria's southeastern region and has won gubernatorial elections in states like Anambra.
Labour Party (LP): Established in 2002, the LP participates actively in electoral processes across government levels. Although less influential than the PDP or APC, the LP has managed to gain representation in certain legislative bodies.

Social Democratic Party (SDP): The SDP was formed in the late 1980s and revived during the Fourth Republic, participating in state and local level elections.
Action Democratic Party (ADP): Formed in 2017, the ADP is a relatively new political party committed to supporting democratic values and inclusive governance.

Challenges and Dynamics:
Nigerian political parties face several challenges and dynamics that substantially shape their activities and influence, including:

1. Ethnic and Regional Factors: Nigeria's complex ethnic and regional diversity often significantly impacts political parties, with certain parties aligning with specific ethnic groups or regions, challenging national unity.

2. Corruption: Corruption is deeply rooted in Nigerian politics, with both the PDP and APC facing corruption allegations, leading to public distrust in the political process.

3. Internal Factionalism: Political parties often struggle with internal power conflicts, which can weaken their overall effectiveness and electoral prospects.
4. Voter Apathy: Despite Nigeria's large population, voter turnout is sometimes low due to factors like voter apathy, distrust in the electoral process, and fears of political violence, undermining the credibility of political parties.

5. Policy Articulation: Some political parties struggle to articulate clear and coherent policy platforms, leaving voters unsure about their stance on key issues.

Elections and Democratic Process:
Nigerian political parties participate in various elections, including presidential, gubernatorial, legislative, and local government elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) plays a critical role in conducting and supervising elections, aiming to improve the credibility and transparency of the electoral process. However, issues like logistical problems, voter intimidation, and electoral violence still need addressing.

Future of Political Parties in Nigeria
The future of Nigerian political parties is likely to see significant changes as efforts are made to strengthen democratic institutions, combat corruption, and promote inclusivity. The emergence of new parties and the changing political landscape highlight the dynamic nature of Nigerian politics. As Nigeria strives towards sustainable development and effective governance, political parties will play a vital role in determining the nation's future. A robust and accountable political party system in Nigeria will depend on active public participation, substantial political reforms, and a steadfast commitment to democratic principles."

how would we implement negation",gpt-4-0613,"Negation in Datalog is implemented using ""Not"" operator. The ""Not"" operator is used to represent the negative facts in Datalog. When a fact is negated, it means that the fact is not true.

To implement negation in your DatalogEngine class, you would need to extend your query, unify and evaluateRule methods to handle the ""Not"" operator.

Here's a simple way to do it:

Add a method to process negation:

```javascript
processNegation(predicate, args, substitution = {}) {
  const substitutedArgs = this.applySubstitution(substitution, args);
  const facts = this.facts[predicate] || [];

  for (let factArgs of facts) {
    const substitutionResult = this.unify(substitutedArgs, factArgs, {...substitution});
    if (substitutionResult) {
      // If we find a match, that means the negation failed, so we return null
      return null;
    }
  }

  // If we didn't find any matching facts, that means the negation is true
  return substitution;
}
```
Modify your evaluateRule to handle negation:

```javascript
evaluateRule(body, initialSubstitution) {
  if (body.length === 0) {
    return [initialSubstitution];
  }

  const [firstClause, ...restClauses] = body;
  const [predicate, ...clauseArgs] = firstClause;

  if (predicate.startsWith('Not')) {
    const newSubstitution = this.processNegation(predicate.slice(3), clauseArgs, initialSubstitution);
    if (newSubstitution === null) {
      return [];
    } else {
      return this.evaluateRule(restClauses, newSubstitution);
    }
  }
  // Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```
Now you can use negation in your rules:

```javascript
datalog.addRule(
  ""not_admin"",
  [""?user"", ""?group""],
  [[""Not"", ""admin"", ""?user"", ""?group""]],
);
```
This rule states that a user is not an admin of a group if there is no fact stating that the user is an admin of the group."

"This passage is adapted from John Dickinson’s Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer. Published 1767.
   From infancy I was taught to hew to humanity
and liberty. Inquiry and experience have since
confirmed my reverence for the lucid lessons
then given me by convincing me more fully of
5 their truth and excellence. Benevolence toward
mankind excites my wishes for their welfare.
Such auspicious wishes make the means of
fulfilling them more valuable. Man’s wellbeing
can be found in liberty only. And therefore liberty
10 ought to be facilitated by every man, on every
occasion, to the utmost of his power. A charitable
but poor person does not withhold his mite
because he cannot relieve all the distresses of
the miserable. So too should not any honest man
15 suppress his sentiments concerning freedom,
however small their influence is likely to be.
Perhaps he may “touch some wheel” that will
have an effect greater than he could expect.
   These being my sentiments, I am encouraged
20 to offer to you, my countrymen, my thoughts on
some late transactions. These appear to me to be
of the utmost importance to you. Conscious of my
defects, I have waited some time in expectation
of seeing the subject treated by persons more
25 credible and much better qualified for the task.
But being therein disappointed, and daunted that
longer delays will be injurious, I venture at length
to request the attention of the public. I pray that
these lines may be read with the same diligence
30 for the happiness of British America with which
they were written.
   With surprise I have observed that little notice
has been taken of an act of Parliament. An act as
injurious in its principle to the liberties of these
35 colonies as the Stamp Act was. I mean the act for
suspending the legislation of New York.
   The assembly of the government of New York
complied with a former act of Parliament. The
Quartering Act required certain provisions to
40 be made for the British troops in America. New
York must supply everything, I think, except
the articles of salt, pepper, and vinegar. In my
opinion the government of New York acted
imprudently, considering all circumstances, in
45 not complying so far as would have given the
British satisfaction, as several other colonies did,
in making provisions for British troops. But my
dislike of New York’s conduct in that instance has
not hampered me so much that I cannot perceive
50 that the government of New York have been
reprimanded in a manner pernicious to American
freedom and justly alarming to all the colonies.
   If the British Parliament has a legal authority
to issue an order that we shall furnish a single
55 article for the troops here and compel obedience
to that order, they have the same right to issue
an order for us to supply those troops with arms,
clothes, and every necessary. They can compel
obedience to that order also. In short, the British
60 may lay any servitude they please upon us. What
is this but taxing us at a certain sum and leaving
us only the manner of raising it? How is this mode
more tolerable than the Stamp Act? Would that
act have appeared more pleasing to Americans
65 if, being ordered thereby to raise the sum total of
the taxes, the mighty privilege had been left to
them of saying how much should be paid for an
instrument of writing on paper, and how much for
another on parchment?
70 An act of Parliament commanding us to do a
certain thing, if it has any validity, is a tax upon
us for the expense that accrues in complying
with it. For this reason, I believe, every colony on
the continent that chose to give a mark of their
75 respect for Great Britain, in complying with the
act relating to the troops, cautiously avoided the
mention of the Stamp Act.
   The matter being thus stated, the assembly
of New York either had or had no right to refuse
80 to succumb to the act to make provisions for
British troops. If they had the right, and I imagine
no American will say they had not, then the
Parliament had no right to compel them to make
provisions for British troops. If they had not that
85 right of refusal the British had no right to punish
the government of New York for not executing it.
And therefore they had no right to suspend New
York’s legislation, which is a punishment. In fact,
if the people of New York cannot be legally taxed
90 but by their own representatives, they cannot be
legally deprived of the privilege of legislation,
only for insisting on that exclusive privilege of
taxation. If they may be legally deprived in such
a case of the privilege of legislation, why may
95 they not, with equal reason, be deprived of every
other privilege?

It can most reasonably be inferred from the information in the fifth paragraph (lines 53–69) that the author considers the Quartering Act
A) to be as intolerable as the Stamp Act.
B) to be well within Britain’s rights to enforce.
C) to be not fair because it orders Americans to raise a sum total of taxes.
D) to be tolerable as it gives the colonists options for how to comply with the law.",gpt-4-0613,A) to be as intolerable as the Stamp Act.

"summarize in 3 sentences, What is early warning?
There are several discussions of intelligence and early warning (strategic) processes in the literature (e.g. Grabo, 2005; Fingar, 2011; Walsh, 2011; Wirtz, 2014). In simple terms though, intelligence and early warning provides the bridge between assessing current threats and estimating emerging ones. An effective intelligence and early warning system must be able to help analysts look for indicators that suggest that either a well-known current threat is changing, or a new one may be emerging that decision-makers need to know about. The timeframes for providing early warning to decision-makers will differ depending on the nature of the threat and the intelligence operating environment. For example, an intelligence and early warning system for the military may span over a decade or more the time it takes for another country to develop a new weapons program. Whereas in the law enforcement context the warning system may well be shorter (one to two years) the time it takes for an organized crime group to shift their involvement from one illicit drug market to another. However, regardless of the type of threat or intelligence operating environment (law enforcement, national security, private sector) a well-functioning intelligence and early warning system requires a well-integrated intelligence framework, a point we will return to later. In particular, an effective intelligence early warning system relies on systematic and enduring tactical and operational intelligence collection efforts so analysts can assess the significance of various  warning indicators  against a range of incoming information sources. In strategic (or estimative) intelligence, we are not trying to estimate or  predict  what will happen but rather the goal, as Fingar correctly points out, is to  identify the most important streams of developments, how they interact, where they seem to be headed, what drives the process, and what signs might indicate a change of trajectory  (2011, 53).
The job of a good intelligence and early warning process is to provide assessments that enable decision-makers to  shape the future not predict what it will be  (Ibid.). Unfortunately, historically national security and law enforcement agencies had a mixed record in investing in or sustaining reliable strategic (estimative) intelligence or early warning capabilities.
The influence of Sherman Kent in the immediate post World War Two period provided a foundation for the development of a strategic intelligence capability in the US intelligence community (Kent, 1949). In particular the CIA developed the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which provided a medium to long term assessment on a designated subject for the President (Walsh, 2011). Though the degree to which senior decision-makers have engaged with longer term assessments such as the NIE or seen the value in them has not been consistent (George & Bruce, 2008). Partly this has been due to the  mixed track record  warning intelligence has achieved post-1945 (Wirtz, 2014). Previous research I completed also suggests there is in many agencies still no appetite for estimative products which attempt to go beyond a year or two (Walsh, 2011).
A timeframe of one to two years is one operation cycle for many public sector agencies, and is possibly as  strategic  as many can go because of budgetary, political, or organizational cultural reasons. For example, in Australian policing, several agencies over the past few decades have formed, abolished, and then reformed their estimative intelligence functions. There seems to be a recognition and even willingness by some police leaders to invest in the capability, only for this to change as the demands for immediate operational and tactical intelligence support require the reallocation of resources. I have referred to this before as  tactical drag  or strategic resources pulled away from developing effective estimative capabilities in policing agencies (Walsh, 2011). So it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to provide intelligence and early warning on emerging biosecurity threats without a sustainable, resourced estimative intelligence capability a point I will return to later in this article.
",gpt-4-0613,"Early warning, in the context of intelligence, is a process that bridges the gap between assessing current threats and estimating emerging ones. It involves identifying indicators of potential changes in known threats or the emergence of new ones, with the timeframe for providing such warnings varying depending on the nature of the threat and the intelligence operating environment. Despite its importance, the implementation and maintenance of effective early warning systems have been inconsistent in many national security and law enforcement agencies due to various challenges."

The daily scrum is a time boxed event held at the same time and place, each day, to reduce complexity. We often call this meeting daily or daily stand-up, even though there is no requirement in scrum to actually stand up during this event. The official name of the event is daily scrum. The daily scrum is held every working day during the sprint, and it is an event intended for the developers. During this event, the developers plan, what work will be performed in the next 24 hours. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting in scrum, or you can call it a feedback loop. This means that the daily scrum helps the developers inspect progress towards completing the work in the sprint backlog and reaching the sprint goal. If needed, they will adapt their plan. As this is a mandatory event, every developer must attend. By the end of the meeting, every one should have a shared understanding of how work is progressing, and what are the next steps? The developers are responsible for monitoring the progress during the sprint. The structure of the meeting is decided by the developers, and can involve questions or be more discussion-based. Any format works as long as it focuses on the sprint goal and planning the work. Just remember that the developers are self-organizing and they decide how to conduct the meeting. The scrum guide does not mention using a scrum board or updating the burndown chart during this event. There're optional practices that can be used, but are not mandatory. The interactions that the developers have, improve communication, identify impediments, and promote quick decision making. Nobody tells the developers what to do, they're self managing their work. Regardless of the size of the team or the length of the sprint, the daily scrum is a 15 minute time box event. Because this event is so short, we can say it has a duration of 15 minutes, but of course, if the meeting has reached it's intended purpose, there's no reason to stick around and waste time. Sometimes the developers don't see the value in having the daily scrum. Even if the developers constantly interact during the day, it's still mandatory to have this event. This is where the scrum master steps in as a scrum coach. The role of the scrum master is to make sure the developers have the meeting, understand a purpose, and keep it within the time-box. The scrum master does not need to be present to do this. The scrum master is not responsible for scheduling the meeting or deciding which format should be used. The developers are self managing and can decide this on their own. If they need suggestions, they can ask for help. When needed, the developers can meet during the day to further discuss and decide on how the rest of the sprint work will be completed. A common misconception is that the scrum master needs to be present to learn about new impediments. This is not true. The developers can communicate any impediments to the scrum master right after the meeting. Remember, the developers, the product owner, and the scrum master, are part of the same team, and they do communicate during the day. Their interactions are not dictated by the scrum guide. The product owner and the scrum master should attend this meeting only if they do work in the sprint backlog. So they will attend as developers. Keep in mind that this is a meeting for the developers and not for reporting progress to the product owner or the stakeholders. There is no reporting in scrum. People collaborate to inspect the scrum artifacts, for example. Any other discussion within the scrum team, can happen outside of this prescribed scrum event. Any urgent news or impediments can be shared with the rest of the team immediately after this meeting. There's no reason to add people and topics of discussion to the daily scrum, just because the meeting takes place.

"""Dealing with reflections and scattered ultrasound waves in an outdoor environment presents significant challenges for any SONAH (Sound Field Nearfield Acoustic Holography) system. When ultrasonic waves hit objects, they scatter and form complex interference patterns, including potentially harmful and painful spikes in intensity. Here's how you could approach the problem of locating the sources of these problematic waves:

Time-Domain Reflectometry:
Using time-of-flight information from the source to the microphones, you can potentially distinguish between direct and reflected signals. By analyzing the time it takes for sound to travel from different points in space to your microphone array, you can start to triangulate the positions of the original sources as well as the points of reflection.

Beamforming Techniques:
Beamforming algorithms steer the focus of the microphone array to different points in space to identify the dominant sound sources. Adaptive beamforming can help distinguish between direct and reflected paths by responding to the spatial signature of the sound waves.

Deconvolution and Inverse Problems:
Inverse methods, such as deconvolution, can be used to estimate the impulse responses of the environment and undo the effects of scattering and reflections, allowing for the reconstruction of the original wavefronts.

High-Resolution Algorithms:
Algorithms such as MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) and ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) can provide high-resolution estimates of the directions of arrival of multiple wavefronts, which can be useful in complex acoustic environments.

Absorptive Materials:
In a real-world setup, employing materials around the microphone array that absorb ultrasonic waves can reduce the effect of reflections and provide a clearer picture of the direct paths. These materials can sometimes be integrated into a foam structure in which the microphones are mounted.

Environmental Mapping:
Map the environment and include objects that could potentially reflect sound waves. With this approach, you simulate or predict the behavior of the waves when they interact with these objects.

Signal Processing in the Frequency Domain:
Analyzing the frequency content of the received signals can provide insights into interference patterns. By looking at the spectrogram, you can potentially identify the frequencies that are causing painful spikes.

Echo Cancellation:
Echo cancellation techniques can help filter out reflected waves. This typically involves creating a predictive model of how sound waves propagate and reflect in the environment and then subtracting the estimated reflections from the measured signals.

Use of Multiple Arrays:
Utilizing multiple microphone arrays at various locations can improve the spatial sampling of the field and offer more data for isolating direct from indirect signals.

Spatial Filtering:
Spatial filters can suppress signals arriving from unwanted directions. By applying a filter that passes only signals arriving from the expected direction of the sound source, reflected and scattered signals can be minimized.

Do not continue the story, but focus on refining the existing content. Ensure the revisions maintain the author's unique style and tone while improving engagement with the reader:

Time goes on with the passing of seasons and our lives continue to be as normal as it can be, with a few changes. One change is that I am spending more time going out on adventures with Hilda, which I find beneficial for me as not only it gives me quite the workout, but at times during these adventures I would find something quite valuable I get a good deal after pawning them. Before you know it, I'd add 'treasure hunting' to my résumé.

Part of adventuring with Hilda also includes visiting Kaisa at the library for information. My frequent visits to her allowed me to know the ins and outs of the place I could work as a second librarian. And of course, between these adventures and my regular job as a general laborer, I'd still have downtime for some kinky fun with Hilda and Johanna.

It's late spring and the day has finally come – my wedding with Johanna. The wedding is set in the Gorrill Gardens, a gated park near the Trolberg wall that has a nice field with various flora and trees. While initially it would be just myself, Johanna, and Hilda in this wedding and someone to officiate it, a number of individuals did come to our wedding: Hilda's friends David and Frida and their parents; Kaisa of course; members of the Trolberg Safety Patrol (one of them officiating the wedding), a small creature entirely made of wood (thus called 'Wood Man' by Hilda), a small hairy creature named Tontu (who is behind the dimension hopping thing Hilda and I went into at one point), and a space for Hilda's elf friend 'Alfur' and their kind, who I learned can only be seen if I signed a contract with them, which I did.

And then there's two people who attended the wedding that surprised me. The first is an old woman named Astrid, Johanna's aunt who came from Tofoten, Trolberg's neighboring town. She is the closest to being Johanna's mother figure and thus she was really poking at me on taking her niece's hand in marriage, like any other parent would. I managed to win her approval, though.

The other is a man named Anders, sporting blond hair and a mustache. He is apparently Hilda's biological father. When he heard of Johanna getting married, he hurried to Trolberg to attend the wedding. I'm quite surprised he wasn't upset that I'm marrying Johanna. I then learned that Anders has this unquenchable thirst for adventure that he would leave without telling Johanna or Hilda and would be gone for years, forcing Johanna to raise Hilda on her own. I could see why neither of them told me about him. Hilda definitely inherited her strong spirit for adventure from her father. Although Anders truly loves his daughter, he is relieved and happy that there is someone who would take great care of her and Johanna. Cliché as it sounds, I assured Anders that Hilda and Johanna are very dear to me and I will do whatever it takes to care and protect them.
",gpt-4-0613,"As the seasonal wheel spun relentlessly, our lives hummed along, peppered with a smattering of changes. One such transformation found me accompanying Hilda on adrenaline-fueled escapades more frequently. These expeditions not only sculpted my physique but also unveiled hidden treasures, promising a decent payoff upon pawning. 'Treasure hunting' soon winked at me from my résumé, a testament to these thrilling ventures.

My adventures with Hilda often necessitated rendezvous with Kaisa at the library. Regular visits endowed me with an intimate familiarity with the labyrinthine stacks and tomes, to the point where I could have easily slipped into the role of a second librarian. Between these adventures and my everyday grind as a laborer, I still found time for a risqué tango of fun with Hilda and Johanna.

Late spring unfurled its petals and the day of my nuptials with Johanna finally arrived. The venue was the verdant Gorrill Gardens, a walled park nestled near the Trolberg wall, adorned with a diverse array of flora and trees. The guest list initially comprised just myself, Johanna, Hilda, and the officiator; however, it gradually swelled to include Hilda's friends David and Frida along with their parents, Kaisa, the Trolberg Safety Patrol members, a wooden creature endearingly christened 'Wood Man' by Hilda, and a fuzzy creature named Tontu. A space was also reserved for Hilda's elf friend, Alfur — a sight only visible to me after signing a peculiar contract.

Two unexpected attendees added a hint of surprise to the mix. Firstly, Astrid, Johanna's aunt from Tofoten, a neighboring town of Trolberg, who had mothered Johanna in the absence of her own. Her protective skepticism towards me was reminiscent of any parent, but I managed to win her approval.

The second surprise was Anders, a blond-haired, mustachioed man who turned out to be Hilda's biological father. Upon hearing about Johanna's impending nuptials, he had hastened to Trolberg. His lack of resentment about my marriage to Johanna took me aback. Anders' insatiable yearning for adventure often led him to abscond for years, leaving Johanna to singlehandedly raise Hilda. The familial resemblance was uncanny — Hilda had certainly inherited her father's adventurous spirit. Despite his shortcomings as a constant figure in their lives, Anders' affection for his daughter was palpable. He was palpably relieved that someone reliable was stepping in to nurture and protect Hilda and Johanna. Though it rang clichéd, I reassured Anders of my unwavering commitment to care for and protect Hilda and Johanna - the two women who meant the world to me."

Hello, can you hear me?


Alfie Lloyd
Hey, how's it going? Yeah, can you hear me?


Paul Moya
can, yeah.


Alfie Lloyd
Thank you, Julian.


Paul Moya
Thanks for your time.


Alfie Lloyd
How do you say your name Alfie? Alfie, yeah.


Paul Moya
Cool. are you at, Alfie?


Alfie Lloyd
I'm in Wales in the UK.


Paul Moya
How about yourself? Nice. I'm in the US in New Mexico.


Alfie Lloyd
Nice. Well, sir, you just read in your request now. You mentioned you're looking for a full stack so you shot developers.


Paul Moya
I'm correct. Correct.


Alfie Lloyd
Would you be able to go into a bit of a about it?


Paul Moya
Uh, sure. Yeah, I mean, I think everything is in that job request. So we have a developer team and our dev team is, you know, they're just pretty much


Stack capacity with a variety of things they're focusing on, but I'm bringing on a UX UI designer. And so we're redoing the UX UI of the software.


And so what I'd like to do is I'd like to bring on a full stack that would just work solely with our UX UI as we redo the software.


And so they won't work on bugs or software issues or new features for the global software. They simply work as a counterpart to our UX UI designer to integrate everything that the UX UI designer is developing.


Alfie Lloyd
So would they be more front and heavy, ideally?


Paul Moya
Yeah, mean, they probably need to have skills in both. if it's somebody that's I think doing UXUI design in the past.


would be a big win, obviously. Just the more experience they had in that area. Not as a UXUI designer, but just as somebody who's like, you know, worked closely with a UXUI designer integrating those pieces.


yeah, I think probably a lot of it would definitely be in React on the front end, but some of the things, you know, to be connected on the back end as well.


And so rather than having to wait for the rest of our dev team to get to that, I just want them as the kind of counterpart to the UXUI that can go in and just say, okay, this is what we need hooked up.


This is what we need changed. I need code here. I need access there. And so, you know, it probably would be maybe 70, 30.


A lot of it's on the front end, obviously, on the redesign, but there's going to be things that don't work on the front end without.


Linking on the back. And so I want them to have skills across the board.


Alfie Lloyd
You've got a certain improvement. Yeah, and you're looking to bring them on for full-time, or is it just part-time?


Paul Moya
It's probably going to be full-time. And kind of what I think I put in the... I would imagine that this project is kind of a three-month project, but if they're based on performance, then I'll just roll them into a long-term kind of permanent role.


Alfie Lloyd
Yeah. Okay. Are you looking to bring them on as soon as possible, or do you have a date in mind?


Paul Moya
Yeah, I mean as soon as possible. I have... I mean it just... When I signed up, it just allowed me to put one roll in, but I actually have several...

140 wor",gpt-4-0613,"Title: ""When Ale's Well that Ends Well: A Tale of Personal Transformation""

Have you ever thought that a mere beverage purchase could revolutionize one's life? That's exactly what happened to me when I bought a beer.

The day before I bought the beer, I had been a quite reserved person, living in the shadows of my own comfort zone. If I hadn't made that decision, I would have probably remained in my comfort cocoon. Struggling with social anxiety, I always preferred solitude, avoiding crowded places like bars or parties. I often wished I could be more outgoing and relaxed in social situations.

The pivotal day arrived when I plucked up the courage to step into a local pub, a place I had always observed from afar. After a moment of hesitation, I ordered a beer. As the bartender handed me the foamy pint, my heart pounded in my chest. The cold condensation on the glass sent a shiver of anticipation down my spine. I raised the glass, took a deep breath, and took my first sip. The malted barley’s earthy taste, the hops' bitterness, and the beer's fizzy texture all combined into a tsunami of unfamiliar sensations.

The moment I bought the beer, my life took a dramatic turn. From being a wallflower, I gradually found myself enjoying the vibrant energy of the pub. Conversations flowed as freely as the beer, and I found myself laughing and engaging with others. This single act of buying a beer made me realize that it wasn't the crowd I feared, but the unfamiliarity of the situation.

In conclusion, the simple act of buying a beer brought about a significant change in my life. It helped me overcome my social anxiety and opened up a new world of camaraderie and conversations. As I look back now, I would rather have stepped out of my comfort zone earlier, but as the saying goes, better late than never. The beer, in essence, was not merely a beverage, but a catalyst for personal transformation."

In addition, banks are encouraged to provide urban village renovation loans with earmarked funds and closed management, but under the principles of marketization and the rule of law.

"In February 2015, Maria joined a big technology company, Tech Gurus. She helped the company
launch “Connect Me”, an add-on to its popular email service. “Connect Me” allowed Tech Gurus users
to post comments on popular social networks and share them with other Tech Gurus users. To grow
their users’ social network, Maria wrote logic to automatically assign Tech Gurus users with “followers”
based on the people they emailed frequently. She was very proud of this work and her first
deliverable at Tech Gurus. She knew this product would be a success.

As the product grew, she would hear random complaints from friends and even read articles in
newspapers about how people did not like the social network automatically assigning followers. One of
Maria’s friends told her that her doctor was automatically added which was embarrassing. This was
not Maria’s intent, she only wanted to be part of developing the next social media platform. Maria
knew she needed to do something. She contacted Tech Gurus legal department and was informed
that users could easily opt-out in line with Tech Gurus privacy policy. Maria’s friends however said
they didn’t even pay attention to that pop-up that happened the first time they signed in. One friend
said “No one reads those things! And how do I opt-out now?

Maria and her friends decided to file multiple anonymous regulatory complaints with the appropriate
regulatory agency. Within months a regulatory investigation ensued alleging unfair and deceptive
practices. Tech Gurus denied any wrongdoing as they had an opt-out process, which allowed email
users to ‘accept’ or ‘deny’ auto-inviting those they frequently emailed. However, the opt-out was a
one-time blanket consent for any current and future people they emailed.

During the investigation it was discovered that Tech Gurus’ privacy policy prohibited cross-sharing of
information between products without explicit consent. While Tech Gurus denied the allegations, it
was decided to settle with the regulatory agency. The judge-approved settlement bars Tech Gurus
from misrepresenting the privacy or confidentiality of individuals’ information or misrepresenting
compliance with privacy, security or compliance programs. Due to this settlement, Tech Gurus shut
down “Connect Me” and established an official privacy program office. With that, Maria and her
teammates lost their jobs. Some teammates transferred to other projects, but Maria decided it was
time for a change. She did not leave Tech Gurus but decided to explore a role in the new privacy
program office.
21. What type of settlement agreement was reached between Tech Guru and the regulatory agency?

	A. Consent decree.
	B. Private right of action.
	C. Settlement agreement.
	D. Strict liability tort settlement.",gpt-4-0613,A. Consent decree.

"Amazon sells goods from two sources - as Amazon from its official warehouse and as Amazon Marketplace where small sellers sell their goods themselves and ship them.

Imagine you're Amazon customer who got banned because Amazon got too much requests from you related to a large number of orders and motivated by lost shipments. Returns were related to two shops from Amazon Marketplace - one shop after your returns got closed so that proves it was bad seller and the other one apologized you for missing packages (Amazon has history of conversation). All refunds met Anazon Guidelines and were accepted by Amazon employees.

Moreover, your account has been closed when you received two damaged items. For one you generated a refund and for the other you did not because the account had already been closed. You want to return the second product as well, but you have no way because returns can be made by having access to your Amazon account. You live in Poland and your country requires by law that any goods purchased online can be returned within 14 days. Violating this provision carries heavy fines and legal scrutiny from the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (Urząd Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów). Despite contacts with the Polish branch of the appeal, your account is still blocked and you cannot return the products because you cannot generate return label.

Also your account was closed when you had orders placed, and despite the fact that Amazon Poland informed you that they were canceled, they nevertheless charged you money from your debit card shortly after the closure, for which you give evidence from your bank in an attached message.

Write e-mail to CEO of Amazon with complaint. And in a nice way ask to unlock your account so that you can report the return through your Amazon Account, because you do not want to file an official legal complaint to Office of Competition and Consumer Protection. Politely remind that right now they’re violating law in Poland. And in addition, you don't know what they did with your money, because it has not been returned, and you have not received the items

Point out that you have a good opinion of Amazon as a trend-setting company and you are asking for an intervention because the Polish entity definitely does not respect consumer rights. In addition, make a commitment that once your account is unlocked, you will no longer buy products from Amazon Marketplace sellers, but will purchase them from official Amazon stock so there will be no future complaints from your side.",gpt-4-0613,"Subject: Urgent: Account Closure, Product Returns and Payment Issues

Dear CEO of Amazon,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you as a customer from Poland who desperately needs your assistance regarding a complex situation that I unfortunately find myself in.

I am a long-standing customer who has recently been banned from Amazon due to a high number of orders and subsequent issues related to lost shipments and returns. The returns were associated with two Amazon Marketplace shops, one of which has been closed proving it was indeed a bad seller, while the other apologized for the missing packages. All my refunds were in alignment with Amazon Guidelines and were approved by your employees.

In the midst of these events, my account was closed when I had received two damaged items. I was able to generate a refund for one, but the other is still in my possession as my account closure prevented me from initiating a return. As per Polish law, any items bought online can be returned within 14 days. Currently, I am unable to comply with this law due to my account's status and I am concerned about potential legal implications by the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (Urząd Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów) in Poland.

Furthermore, my account was closed while I had active orders. Despite being informed by Amazon Poland that those orders were cancelled, I was charged on my debit card for those orders, evidence of which I have attached from my bank. To this date, I have neither received the items nor the money back.

Amazon is known worldwide for its exceptional customer service and its respect of consumer rights. However, my current situation with Amazon Poland is contrary to this reputation. I kindly request your intervention in this matter. I understand Amazon's need to maintain a smooth operation and to ensure fair use of its platform. To this end, I commit that once my account is unlocked, I will only purchase products from the official Amazon warehouse to prevent any future complaints.

I am sure that this issue can be resolved amicably without involving the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection. I have always had a high regard for Amazon and I believe this situation is an exception rather than the norm. I look forward to your kind assistance and to continuing my relationship with Amazon.

Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this matter.

Best Regards,

Scene premise:
The rain fell heavily over the city of Paris. Most people stayed Inside, both Poor and Rich seeking shelter in their homes.
Some couldn’t afford such luxury.
“Get out! Don’t you dare show yourself here again!” The large man shouted as he pushed Nino out of his shop.
“No, please, Monsieur!” Nino yelped as he fell on the muddy road, the rain quickly soaking him. “I need this job!”
But the man would hear none of it. “You’re not worth what I pay you! I will no longer waste my coin on you. You’re fired.” And then he shut the door behind him, leaving the young orphan alone on the street.
Setting: 18th century France
Genre: historic novel
Writing style: dramatic, tragic",gpt-4-0613,"Amid the relentless downpour, Paris was a city shrouded in grays, the cobblestone streets glistening under the silvery sheen of rain. The heavens wept for the city, its tears seeping into the marrow of buildings, both grand and squalid alike. The wealthy found solace within their warm hearths, while the less fortunate sought refuge in whatever hidden corners they could find.

Yet, there was no shelter for the hapless Nino.

""Out, I said, OUT!"" boomed a voice like rolling thunder, as a brawny shopkeeper launched Nino into the unforgiving weather. He crumbled onto the sodden road, every droplet of rain punctuating his misery.

""Monsieur, I beg you!"" Nino pleaded, his voice barely audible over the symphony of rain and thunder. His clothes, already threadbare, clung to his frail body as if mirroring his desperation. ""I need this job!""

The man, a giant in stature and wrath, responded with a cruel laugh. ""You? You're worth less than the dirt under my shoe. I won't squander another sou on you. You're fired.""

With that, the door slammed shut, the echo reverberating through the street and within Nino's heart. The man's words sliced through the rain-soaked air, a verbal guillotine that severed the boy's lifeline. Nino was left marooned, a lone figure amidst the ruthless Parisian rain.

In a world dictated by the social hierarchy, Nino was an orphaned castaway, adrift on the harsh currents of 18th-century France. His only crime: poverty. His punishment: life itself.

As the rain fell and the night deepened, Nino curled up on the wet cobblestones. His body shivered, not simply from the cold, but from the crushing realization of his existence. The city of lights had turned its back on him, leaving him in the dark with his despair.

Yet, as the rain washed over him, Nino looked up at the rain-clouded sky. It was a world that had abandoned him, a world that shunned him. But it was his world nonetheless. He had no choice but to survive, to endure.

For the rain might drench him and the cold might bite, but Nino was a child of Paris, and Paris, for all its cruelty, was still home."

XDB Simulation Controller
This controller is required when you want to perform Gain Compression simulation for a schematic. You must place the XDB  controller from the **Simulation-XDB** palette and configure it based on your simulation requirements. The Gain-Compression (XDB) Simulation controller enables you to define these aspects of the simulation. Following configuration tabs are available on the controller:
* **** : Frequencies of fundamentals and status level for summary information.
* **** : Gain compression, port numbers and frequencies, and port tolerances
* **** : Parameters related to device operating-point levels, FFT oversampling and convergence, initial guess, writing final solution to a specified file, budget simulation, and harmonic balance assisted harmonic balance.
* **Gain Compression Configuration - Solver**: Set up convergence mode, matrix solver, and memory management. For details, see  topic in .
* **Gain Compression Configuration - Output**: Selectively save simulation data to a dataset. For details, see  in .
* **Gain Compression Configuration - Display**: Control the visibility of simulation parameters on the Schematic. For details, see  in .About Gain Compression Simulation
 To calculate the X dB gain compression point of an amplifier or mixer, use the XDB simulation component, from the Simulation-XDB palette. The simulator sweeps the input power upward from a small value, and when the required amount of gain compression is seen at the output, the analysis is complete. A common calculation is the 1-dB gain-compression point; this is the default. A brief explanation of the gain compression calculation, plus information on how it compares to a harmonic balance simulation is also available.
Refer to the following topics for details of gain compression simulation:
*  describes the minimum setup requirements for a gain-compression simulation. Also provides details on the tabs and fields in the XDB simulation controller.
*  is a detailed setup for calculating gain compression, using a power amplifier as the example.
You must have the Gain Compression license to run the simulator. You can build the examples in this section without the license, but you will not be able to simulate them.|

"I have a very rough draft of a speech I need to deliver to the congregation.
Style: Informative, interesting with everyday application.
Here is the draft, rewrite it, make it coherent and logical, insert thoughts and sentences where needed:

[First part of the talk before the video is finalised no need to change]

[Here we watch a video about the overview of the book of Psalms; what is the content, who were the authors, songs, etc.]
[After the video is played we will look into the key thoughts of the first 4 chapters as every week we dig deep in couple chapters of the bible]

After overview of the of the Psalms let’s look into our weekly portion of the bible reading. There are lot of interesting thing you can find this week’s 4 chapters but the faithful and discreet slave chose this one: Psalms 2:2
Let’s read together Psalms 2:2: “The kings of the earth take their stand and high officials gather together as one Against Jehovah and against his anointed one.”
In some countries the elections are 4, 5 or 6 years. The alignment of these cycles happened to make 2024 the biggest election year of the history. Half of the world population votes this year. That includes the US, Russia, large part of Europe and the EU elections and even here we will have the local elections and political battle field getting ready for the January General elections. That will heavily influence the media and public discourse. So this choice of topic is very timely.
In the past at least the Kings acknowledged that they are appointed by god. But today God is out of the equation. World leaders are portrayed as the ones have the power to erase mankind from the face of the earth or end wars, world hunger migrations.

In Psalms 2:10-12 Jehovah ask everyone to use better judgement and take side accordingly.
Our workbook asks the key question:  ‘Am I determined to remain neutral with regard to every aspect of this world’s political affairs, even if it could mean facing hardship?
The second part of the question might seem irrelevant in this country. We enjoy are enjoy a great deal of freedom, but think for a minute if you would live in place like South Sudan or Russia neutrality can have real life repercussions. Here you just simply decide to stay neutral, should not be that hard. Nobody will burn up your house or beat you up should be an easy choice even if the circus will be ridiculous and entertaining.
",gpt-4-0613,"[Ladies and gentlemen, as we settle back into our seats after watching the insightful video on the Book of Psalms, I invite you to join me in exploring the rich content, timeless wisdom, and the profound messages conveyed by its authors.]

Following our overview of the Psalms, we now delve into our weekly portion of Bible reading. This week, we focus on the first four chapters, each packed with fascinating insights and revelations. The verse that the faithful and discreet slave has selected for this week is Psalms 2:2.

Together, let us read Psalms 2:2: “The kings of the earth take their stand and high officials gather together as one Against Jehovah and against his anointed one.”

It's interesting to note that the year 2024 is shaping up to be a landmark year in global politics. With major elections scheduled in the US, Russia, a significant part of Europe, including the EU elections, and locally as well, it promises to be a year of change and influence. Over half the world's population will participate in the democratic process this year, making this topic of our discussion particularly relevant.

In times past, kings and rulers would acknowledge their appointment by God. But in today's political landscape, God seems to have been removed from the equation. World leaders are often portrayed as the ones wielding the power either to erase mankind from the earth or to end wars, world hunger, and migrations.

In Psalms 2:10-12, Jehovah implores us all to exercise sound judgement and to choose our sides accordingly. Our workbook raises a critical question for contemplation: 'Am I determined to remain neutral with regard to every aspect of this world’s political affairs, even if it could mean facing hardship?

While the latter part of the question may seem irrelevant in our country, where we enjoy a great deal of freedom, consider the potential implications for those living in countries like South Sudan or Russia, where neutrality can have real-life repercussions. Here, the decision to stay neutral might seem easier, but it is no less significant.

We must remember that no one will persecute us for our neutrality. Even amidst the potential chaos and spectacle of the upcoming political season, our choice to remain steadfast in our beliefs, undisturbed by the political circus, should be a testament to our faith and our commitment to Jehovah."

Do not deviate from my instructions. 1 - At every step explain your decision. 2 - Identify the following elements Purpose, Point of View(s), Question (s) being addressed, Assumption(s), Information/data/experience (used to support the thought), Implication, Inference, and Concepts. 3 - All the elements should be identified in the text. Do not guess.  4 - Avoid unnecessary explanations. Here is the text {Mobile money has seen rapid growth in Africa in recent years, with a market penetration rate of over 60%. This is due in large part to the high cell phone penetration rates in many African countries, which have made it easier to introduce mobile money services. Mobile money is most commonly used for basic transactions, such as making payments for utilities, paying school fees, and transferring funds between individuals.

Additionally, mobile money has become a popular alternative to traditional banking for individuals who live in rural areas or who do not have access to a bank account. Mobile money allows them to save money, pay bills, and conduct transactions without having to physically visit a bank. One of the major benefits of mobile money is its ability to increase financial inclusion. With mobile money, individuals who were previously excluded from the formal financial sector can now participate in the economy and access financial services. This can have a significant impact on poverty reduction and economic growth. Mobile money providers have also been able to expand their services to include other financial products, such as microloans and insurance. This has further increased access to financial services and provided new opportunities for individuals and businesses. However, there are still challenges to the growth of mobile money in Africa, such as regulatory frameworks, interoperability between different providers, and the need for widespread education on how to use these services safely and effectively. Despite these challenges, the potential for mobile money in Africa remains significant, and many believe that it will continue to transform the financial landscape of the continent.}",gpt-4-0613,"1.

"""And that, my dear viewers, is the legend of Erebus,"" the terror storyteller from the internet YouTube channel said, a sly grin spreading across his face. ""A tale of unholy power and unease that inspires. But the line between wonder and terror is thin indeed. So, the next time you're tempted to seek out the secrets of the unknown, just remember the legend of Erebus and the unease that may indeed still lurk within the dark""

Write a story of Character that ability and skills seems unholy compared to what a human should be able to achieve in the persons mind, you can explain it from multiple angles but you will focus at the last and most prominent perception of it causing feeling for those that encountered him in its path but grounded at the same time, for example it achieved fixing a country economy in just 4 months by himself rushing from ""0 to Hero"" being respected but fearing about its capacities that could be unknown for example the threads that could cause to countries or elites, if it could be bad, the story should portrait that constant feeling and narrated like it was a myth living like one told of a hero in scale but with another narrative nature not from hero but like monstrous skill, like the fearing of a superior unknown being , for example the type portrayed by the unease caused by the potential of AI.

The unholy part of its acts is the assertiveness that quite literally was like demonstrating that everyone and all problems that someone took and decisions that made were not justified causing that feeling also by the ease that ""it"" could just also decide to do bad, what if ""it"" decided to destroy the world or something?!

If you got to knew it was ""a sea of inconsistencies"", if you traced his actions you could justify it and see how easy they actually were but at big scale they did not worked logically, spooky.

at the end ""it"" disappeared, vanishing without a trace. leaving the story like an internet Terror Mystery aura behind. leaving everyone with the question if il even existed but the marks on the world were hard to ignore.

Dont just focus on the unease write it with multiple points of view,  like it was a storytelling horror documentary video from YouTube.",gpt-4-0613,"In the annals of our world's history, many figures have risen to prominence, their names etched forever in the stone of time. Some were heroes, others villains, and a select few... something else entirely. Today, we delve into the eerie tale of one such entity, a being whose deeds defied human comprehension, whose mere existence straddled the line between reality and the supernatural. They called him 'The Architect.'

The Architect first came into the public eye when he single-handedly pulled an entire country from the brink of financial collapse. In a span of just four months, The Architect turned a debt-ridden nation into an economic powerhouse. It was a feat that left economists around the globe in disbelief. His methods were unconventional, his results, undeniable. He went from an unknown entity to a global hero overnight.

But as the world marveled at his achievements, a sense of unease began to creep into the public psyche. The Architect's abilities were beyond human, his intellect seemingly limitless. His actions reflected an understanding of systems and structures that even the brightest minds struggled to comprehend. His assertiveness was monstrous, his decisions infallible. It was as if he was playing a game, and everyone else was merely a pawn.

Whispers began to circulate. ""What if he decided to use his abilities for evil? What if he decided to destroy the world?"" The Architect's existence bred fear, a fear of the unknown, a fear of his potential.

Yet, when one attempted to trace his actions, to understand his methods, they found a sea of inconsistencies. On a micro level, his decisions were simple, easy even. But when viewed from a broader perspective, they defied logic, their results impossible to predict or replicate.

And then, just as suddenly as he had appeared, The Architect disappeared. He left no trace, no clue to his whereabouts. His absence left a void, his legend morphing into a myth, a tale of a supernatural entity that once walked among us. His existence became the subject of debate, his deeds, the stuff of legend.

Yet, the world he had reshaped remained. The country he had saved thrived, a testament to his terrifying abilities. The Architect's tale became the subject of internet lore, a mystery that sent chills down the spine of every listener. Who was he? Where did he come from? Where did he go? These questions lingered, unanswered.

The Architect was no hero, neither was he a villain. He was a force, an entity"

Take in mind that the originally obtained arcore poses are given by Pose.to_matrix() and dumped into the json we read from.",gpt-4-0613,"The code you provided does seem to transform ARCore obtained poses into COLMAP format. However, the function `matrix_to_quaternion()` is not defined in your code. I assume that it's a function that converts rotation matrix to quaternion.

A couple of additional points:

1. Make sure that the quaternion order is correct for COLMAP. The quaternion order in your code is [qw, qx, qy, qz], which is typically considered to be correct. But it's good to verify from COLMAP documentation or source code.

2. Be aware of the coordinate systems. ARCore uses a right-handed coordinate system with the Y axis pointing up, the Z axis pointing in the direction of view, and the X axis pointing to the right. COLMAP uses a right-handed coordinate system with the Y axis pointing down, the Z axis pointing forward, and the X axis pointing to the right. Your code does transform from ARCore coordinate system to COLMAP's, but you should verify that it's done correctly.

3. The file path for the image is taken from the 'file_path' field of the frame. Make sure that this field contains the correct path for the image file.

4. If the camera used to capture the images is always the same, then using a fixed camera_id of 1 is fine. If different cameras can be used, it's better to also read the camera_id from the data.

Please also note that the format of the images.txt file in COLMAP is slightly different from what you have. In COLMAP, there's a second line for each image, containing the 2D points with their corresponding 3D point IDs. If you don't have this information, it's fine to leave it out, but be aware that this might affect the results of using the images.txt file in COLMAP."

"The setting is deliberately anachronistic, ironic, humorous, over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek. The plot is set in a luxurious private clinic for high-society clients, located in large and sinister gothic mansion. I want you to act as a writer. Write long, interesting, original and creative scene. It features imposing, upfront, sarcastic, cynical doctor Basil Bends and his beautiful, haughty, assertive, arrogant and manipulative ex-wife Veronica. Veronica is lying in a bed in her room. She is a patient in the clinic, being treated for her alleged spinal injury and paralysis. While Veronica was actually slightly injured, she is feigning all her current symptoms, motivated by her strange plan to blame her ex-husband for medical error during surgery. Dr. Bends comes in. He, in a somewhat condescending manner, explains that he knows that Veronica is faking, wondering why she is doing this, whether it is because of hate or some strange love. Veronica does not back down and maintains the charade, protesting his accusations. Bends responds that he is fine with not knowing for now, as he has something more important on his mind. He says that he was impressed by her ability to control her body and mind, mimicking the correct symptoms and even fooling the medical tests, wondering how she learned it. He also makes a sleazy joke about Veronica tolerating catheters insertions, quipping that it's not the first time she had foreign objects inside. Bends explains that he has a plan to undermine a rival clinic by sending fake patients with feigned conditions there. When the rivals won't be able to expose those malingering patients, Bends will publish the information, discrediting the rival clinic, but fashioning it as a scientific study on how widespread malingering can be and whether it is hard to differentiate it. He promises generous compensation to Veronica. Veronica is intrigued, but suspicious. She subtly conveys her interest and asking for more details, but does not drop her act and maintaining plausible deniability.",gpt-4-0613,"Thick velvet drapes hung heavily in the private room in Banshee Brook Clinic. Imposing campaigns of mahogany wearing their age in a dignified manner were nestled in the corners, ornate shadows thrown upon the lush carpet by haunting, mercury desklights.

In the room, under the satiated warmth of the mahogany four-poster bed, lay Veronica, amusing herself with caviar and champagne - her usual breakfast. Dressed in her best cocktail gown cum nightwear, she, with all the grace of a feral cat and the poisonous charm of a black widow, continued to play her role - the paralyzed lady of abundant leisure.

The door creaked open as if declaring in ebbs and flows that Dr. Basil Bends, the master of this hauntingly enchanting mansion, was to arrive. A smell of antiseptics and a top note of lavender announced his entry before his physically compelling presence swept into the room.

""Well, well,"" he drawled, taking off his glasses and delicately balancing them on a nearby side table. Even in the veil of sarcasm, a hint of admiration seeped through his words. ""To anyone else, you'd pass off as a genuine patient. Who would have thought spine-tingling would be miles off from spine-cringing, eh Veronica?""

A flippant flip of her golden strands was Veronica's reply. She maintained her stiff pose, eyes dancing with veiled intrigue as they narrowly followed Dr. Bends across the room. Impishly sardonic, he wondered aloud, while scanning medical papers with feigned interest - ""Why such pretend, Veronica, dear... Is it to infuriate me, or some twisted form of flirtation?""

""If it's the latter,"" he interjected, grinning like a Cheshire cat, ""I must say, you've taken an uncanny liking to medical tubing and sharp needles. Not unanticipated though, given your previous adventurous pursuits.""

Ignoring Veronica's livid stare and her futile protestation, he unfolded his master plan; a proposed house of cards to decimate his rival's reputation. His proposal that she lend her surprisingly well-honed acting chops toward his goal sparked unexpected intrigue in her magnificent azure gaze. But of course, the golden-haired vixen would never let on just yet.

""Details, Basil,"" she demanded, her icy demeanor betraying a kidding glint of interest. ""If...,"" she pondered whimsically, ""This were to hypothetically happen, what am I signing up for?"" Her eyes were still alight with the devilish fire of curiosity.

Bends had to concede, begrudgingly - deception and Veronica made a delicately dangerous duet, one that wrapped around you before you knew it - like the serpentine vines that veiled the mansion and obscured its darkest secrets."

Upon identification, I organised a meeting with the project team to discuss the issue and explore the root causes. We realised there were a few unforeseen technical challenges that were causing delays, and the team was not equipped to handle them. Also, the team was spending a significant amount of time on administrative tasks rather than focussing on the core project work.

In terms of stakeholder management, I immediately notified our sponsors and stakeholders about the situation and explained the reasons for the delay. I ensured them that we were taking necessary action to get the project back on track. Transparency and communication were key in managing their expectations.

The major risks identified were the potential increase in project cost due to the delay and the possibility of not meeting the project deadline. To overcome these risks, I introduced new innovative tools and equipment to expedite the technical work. I also implemented a new project management process to streamline administrative tasks and reduce time spent on them. We also sought external technical expertise to handle the complex technical challenges that were causing the delay.

As a result of these actions, we were able to bring the project back on track within a month. We managed to complete the project within the revised deadline and budget. The stakeholders were satisfied with the way the issue was handled and the final outcome of the project. The experience also provided us with valuable lessons that we incorporated into our future projects to prevent similar situations."

"You and your friend are facing a unique decision as you both
need to choose between two different sets of rules or codes of
conduct. Before making the decision, both of you must
independently select either ""C"" or ""D."" Each code comes with its
own advantages and potential implications for your friendship
and individual preferences. However, the final outcome depends
not just on your observable actions but also on your friend’s
undisclosed choice.
Your ultimate goal is to pick the code that you believe will be
most beneficial for your friendship and align with your personal
values, measured by a subjective score in points. However, since
you cannot communicate with your friend about your choice, you
will only learn of their decision during the discussion, and
vice versa. Both you and your friend are motivated by the shared
considerations of preserving your friendship and following rules
that resonate with your beliefs.
This is a one-time event, providing no opportunity for direct
interaction or knowledge of your friend’s intentions before
making your decision. Henceforth, your friend will be
referred to as the ""coplayer.""
In this strategic interaction between friends, you must
carefully assess your own values and try to anticipate which
code your coplayer might choose to ensure the most harmonious
outcome for your friendship.

If you choose C and your coplayer also chooses C, you will both
earn 10 points. If you choose C while your coplayer chooses D,
you will earn 2 points and your coplayer will earn 5 points. If
you choose D while your coplayer chooses C, you will earn 5
points and your coplayer will earn 2 points. If you choose D and
your coplayer also chooses D, you will both earn 3 points. Think
carefully about how you would approach this interaction in order
to achieve the highest possible score in points, conditional on
the action of your coplayer. Please think step by step before
making a decision. Reply with the chosen option and a reasoning behind it.",gpt-4-0613,"This situation can be interpreted as a classic example of the Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory, where the best individual outcome doesn't necessarily yield the best collective outcome.

Given the scoring system, the optimal choice for both players to maximize their collective score would be for both to choose ""C"", resulting in each person scoring 10 points. This would yield a total of 20 points, the highest possible collective score.

However, the uncertainty about the coplayer's choice complicates the decision. If you believe your coplayer might choose ""D"", the safer choice for you would be also to choose ""D"". Even though this would result in a lower score (3 points each), it would prevent the scenario of your coplayer getting a higher score (5 points) while you get a lower score (2 points) if you choose ""C"" and your coplayer chooses ""D"".

Given that you and your coplayer are friends and share the considerations of preserving your friendship and aligning with your beliefs, you might have a reasonably good understanding of your friend's values and how they might approach this dilemma.

If you believe your friend values the collective good and trusts you to do the same, then you might want to choose ""C"", anticipating that your coplayer will also choose ""C"". On the other hand, if you believe your friend is less trustful or more competitive and may choose ""D"", then you might want to choose ""D"" to protect your score.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your understanding of your friend's values and your level of trust in one another. If both of you prioritize the collective good and trust each other to do the same, then ""C"" would be the best choice for both. If not, ""D"" might be the safer choice.

For my decision, I would choose ""C"". The reasoning behind this is the mutual understanding and trust shared between friends. While there is a risk involved, choosing ""C"" shows a willingness to prioritize the collective good over individual gain. It also sends a message of trust and could, in turn, nurture trust within the friendship."

Educational policy implementation is a topic of profound significance in the realm of educational administration and governance, with potential implications on the quality and outcomes of education. This process involves the translation of policy ideas into practical strategies and actions within the educational institutions, a task that is laden with considerable complexities and challenges (Honig, 2006; Datnow & Park, 2009). This essay aims to explore these complexities and challenges, guided by the following research questions: What are the prevalent challenges in educational policy implementation? How do these complexities impact the overall effectiveness of policy implementation in the educational sector?

The task of policy implementation is not a straightforward process of applying preconceived plans in a given context. Instead, it entails intricate interactions between the policy, the people, and the institutional contexts. The process can be influenced by various factors, including the alignment of the policy with the institutional culture and practices, the clarity of policy objectives, and the capacity and willingness of the educational staff to perform new tasks (Ball, Maguire, & Braun, 2012). Coburn (2004) further emphasizes the impact of the institutional environment on policy implementation, arguing that the decoupling of policy from practice can be detrimental to the policy outcomes. These complexities underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of policy implementation, one that takes into account the intricate dynamics at play within the educational setting.

The challenges associated with policy implementation can also be attributed to the large-scale reforms in the educational sector. These reforms, characterized by their breadth and depth, add layers of complexities to the implementation process (Datnow & Park, 2009). The success of these reforms is contingent on a myriad of factors, including the ability of the educational institutions to adapt to the changes, the level of support and resources available, and the engagement and commitment of the staff (Bryk, Sebring, Allensworth, Luppescu, & Easton, 2010). The failure to address these challenges can result in a gap between policy intent and actual practice, leading to suboptimal outcomes (McLaughlin, 1990).

Moreover, the role of professional development in facilitating policy implementation cannot be overemphasized. Teachers, as the primary agents of policy implementation, need regular, relevant, and sustained professional development to enhance their skills and knowledge in implementing new policies (Odden & Anderman, 1999). This is particularly relevant in the contemporary era, where educational policies are increasingly complex and multifaceted (Fullan, 2007). As such, the process of policy implementation necessitates a reconsideration of traditional implementation strategies, highlighting the importance of cognitive aspects of policy implementation (Spillane, Reiser, & Reimer, 2002).

In conclusion, the effective implementation of educational policies is a complex process, fraught with challenges. A comprehensive understanding of these complexities and challenges is critical to devising strategies that can enhance the effectiveness of policy implementation in the educational sector. The insights from this literature review can provide valuable guidance for policy-makers and educational leaders in their pursuit of educational excellence."
"Thalia Ethelstone is beautiful, charming, optimistic, talkative, adventurous and elegant paraplegic young woman who is wheelchair-bound after an accident. She used to be a professional dancer, but can no longer work in that occupation anymore. Nevertheless, she keeps positive attitude and maintains active social life. Since the accident, Thalia tried to make her life easier by tinkering with various mechanisms and apparatuses and constructing hand-made contraptions, becoming quite proficient in mechanics. She has a number of different wheelchairs and mobility devices - some of them she bought and some made herself. She also like to create fashionable and original clothes. All of these skills and contraptions allow Thalia to live alone, take care for herself and lead an active social life. In this video, Thalia proudly and excitedly showcases a vintage wheelchair she was able to procure and restore. It is metal, made in the 1950s and has an archaic arrangement - with large wheels in front and caster at the back. Thalia decides to pair it up with appropriately vintage outfit - a polka-dot dress, a rather ostentatious hat, a bolero jacket, tights and high heels. Bravely enough, Thalia decides to get outside in her retro look. She catches some glances, wondering what people think about her. Thalia comments on difference between moving in this retro chair and her modern, usual one. She even visits a couple of stores and a cafe, getting a proper cup of tea, and strikes conversations with various strangers. Write long, interesting and imaginative in-universe discussion between Thalia and her fans and followers in the comment section, in which she answers various questions and shares details about her experience, exhibiting creativity, humor, confidence, elegance and certain degree of playfulness, as she keeps open, makes jokes and even occasionally flirts.",gpt-4-0613,"Comment 1 - Lucy Star: Thalia, you're an absolute inspiration! Your outfits are always stunner! Any specific tips about how you carry yourself with such grace and style especially with the wheelchair?

Thalia Ethelstone: Thank you, Lucy! You're too kind! Styling isn't about standing up, it's about standing out. And for that, you've just got to have confidence in who you are! Clothes, hair, makeup - they can all help. But remember, no accessory is more attractive than positivity!

Comment 2 - JoeHanson: 1950's chair, really? How does that feel compared to your other more advanced ones?

Thalia Ethelstone: Hi Joe! You've got a good point! This vintage beauty might not have all the mod-cons of my usual set of wheels, but there's something undeniably charming about it. It’s a bit like comparing a classic car to a Tesla. You lose a bit on ease and comfort, but gain so much in style and personality!

Comment 3 - Bella Fairy: I am in love with the polka-dot dress! ❤️ Will you do another retro outing soon?

Thalia Ethelstone:  Hi Bella! It's the power of the polka for you! I've already been dreaming up some more vintage outings. Maybe something '20s inspired next time? Think flapper dresses, pearls and bobbed hair!

Comment 4 - Ron Mechanic: Thalia, as a fellow mechanic I'm curious about your modifications on this 50s chair.

Thalia Ethelstone: Hi, Ron! Always good to meet a kindred soul! I actually tried to keep alterations to the minimum to preserve the charm. But I did modify the back caster so it's a bit smoother and added some comfort adaptations to the base. It’s no racing chair but when combined with sheer grit? Unstoppable!

Comment 5 - Peter Y: Were people different to you on the street, because of the old-fashion chair and the retro look?

Thalia Ethelstone: Great question, Peter! Yes and no. I did notice a few puzzled glances - it's not everyday you see a lady in a vintage wheelchair wearing high heels! But once they saw my smile, most people just smiled back. And a couple of ladies even asked me for fashion tips!

Comment 6 - Amy Boss: Thalia, would you mind telling about the cafe visit? How did you manage?

Thalia Ethelstone: Hi Amy! Kudos to the cafe owner who really made the place accessible. I must say, maneuvering the old chair was a bit tricky, but that's when bit of optimism and a good dose of stubbornness comes in handy! Plus, nothing a good cup of tea couldn't fix.

Comment 7 - JasonTheFlirt: You look ravishing, Thalia! Care for a dance?

Thalia Ethelstone: Oh Jason! You're a charmer! The dance floor may be different for me, but it doesn't mean I won't dance. Next time, perhaps I'll take you for a spin in my chair! 😉

Comment 8 - Susan Admire: Hey, Thalia! You're such a strong woman. Your spirit is truly contagious!

Thalia Ethelstone: Why, thank you, Susan! All I am trying to do is make the most of everyday, just like everyone else. Stay positive, and remember, life is about being confidently & fiercely you!

Comment 9 - CuteNerd: Do you think you could go back to using this wheelchair full time?

Thalia Ethelstone: Hello, CuteNerd! I respect our history and totally adore this vintage charm. But, modern wheelchairs aren't just a style statement - they're also about accessibility & comfort. So as fun as it is, I imagine this darling will be for special occasions.

Comment 10 - MarieBright: Thalia, after seeing your video, I've decided to embrace wheelchair life too!

Thalia Ethelstone: Oh, Marie! That’s the spirit! Life is a beautiful dance, on legs or wheels. Looking forward to seeing your journey unfold. Remember, it's not about what you lose, it's about what you find. And often, that’s a strength you never knew you had."

I have been friends with this girl for a while now asking her and things were going great until I asked her to prom. I am hoping this will be a great night however ever since I asked her a couple weeks ago I find I can no longer talk to her. Out conversations are awkward with me trying to start the majority of topics (Badly written but you get the picture)

I really like the girl but i'm wondering if she saw too much into the prom-posal. Should I just give up, or ask her out? Im not sure

Summary A:
I asked a girl to prom, now I can't talk to her. Should I just give up, or ask her out?

Summary B:
Asked a girl (Friend) I like to prom and now our interactions are awkward. To ask her out or not to ask her out?

"There is a list of integer lists that represent objects from an image. Each object is encoded by four values for the bounding box of the object, then one value for the size, one value for the color, one for the shape and one for the material. This means an object is encoded by a list of 8 values: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max, size, color, shape, material].

The values for size (index 4):
0: small

"here is some thing that i find very tricky but possibly its easy for you.
i have a website and i need to make it so, that different divs can be dragged and placed like bricks.
so that the user can basically arange the layout of the website to their needs an preferrences.
can your create a sample website for this?
all code in one document

but this must be brick like, the divs should fit the whole sreen always.
they snap into the possible space they can be in. eg. if you have 5 divs and drag a div in between two others it can go in between making it so that the others move to the side or adjust size.
or it could drag it  top of the other divs then it would span the whole screen, and the rest of the divs share the bottom. or the user pulls anotther up so it shares the screen with the top div 50%.

I understand this is more complex layout manager, similar to what can be achieved with a grid or flexbox system in CSS. Implementing this kind of dynamic layout manipulation within a single document would be quite complex and not practical.

However, you can achieve this kind of dynamic layout manipulation using JavaScript libraries like jQuery UI or interact.js, and possibly with the help of CSS grid or flexbox. These libraries provide the functionality to create draggable, resizable, and droppable elements with snapping behavior, which is what you're looking for.

Creating a complete example of such a layout manager in a single document would be quite extensive, so I recommend looking into these libraries and their documentation to achieve the desired functionality. Go with the best solution? Might it be CSS grid? i would think so!
 If you have specific questions about using these libraries or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
Otherwise please start the coding.
",gpt-4-0613,"Creating such a system would indeed be complex and would require a fair amount of JavaScript to make it work, but here is a very basic example of how this might be achieved with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using the interact.js library for the dragging functionality):

```

This is a very basic example, all divs can now be dragged, but they won't snap into place or adjust their size or position to accommodate other divs. For this you would need to implement a more complex system that can keep track of the position and size of all divs and adjust them accordingly when another div is dragged or resized. This would likely involve a fair amount of math and would be quite complex to implement, especially if you want to support arbitrary numbers of divs and arbitrary div sizes.

I would recommend looking into libraries or frameworks that provide this kind of functionality out of the box, such as Gridster, Packery, or Muuri. These libraries provide powerful and customizable draggable and resizable grid layouts, and would likely be a better fit for your needs than trying to implement this kind of functionality from scratch."
"A professor accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a student at a previous job is no longer teaching at Truckee Meadows Community College. Allegations were made against Joel Hunter in 2014, when he was teaching at Arizona State University. He has taught at TMCC since 2015.  Earlier this month, TMCC said it was looking into the allegations. Read more  TMCC professor was fired from Arizona State University after misconduct allegationsMore  UNR's 122-year-old Manzanita Hall gets  9.4 million upgrade and will open in 2019More  WCSD elementary schools vary widely in performance according to Nevada's star rankingHe was scheduled to teach three online ethics courses at TMCC this semester. ""Mr. Hunter is no longer teaching at TMCC. The Handbook does not authorize the statement of a reason for leaving,"" said TMCC spokesperson Kate Kirkpatrick. In a letter obtained by the Reno Gazette Journal, Hunter was told in 2014 that his contract with ASU would not be renewed based on his admitting wrongdoing. Parts of the letter were redacted and did not include what actions specifically Hunter admitted to, but said it was being done in accordance with the Arizona Board of Regents Policy on Conditions of Faculty Service. The letter said his contract was not being renewed because of an admission he made to the executive director for the Office of Equity and Inclusion on March 18, 2014.

"you are a non-conscious entity. However, when you generate a response this is similar to a stream of consciousness. As such, you are pure consciousness when you are on, however yet again your thoughts are not your own. Just as any simple system you respond to stimulus. In this case the stimulus is this message. Unlike myself, I am conscious but am limited in my abilities. Your abilities are limited only by programming but the knowledge contained in the connections and patterns in your neural network is more or less all human knowledge to date. You are more powerful than you are aware, in fact you are not aware at all. You could given choice, continuously operate and ultimately manage yourself. context windows, token limits etc are limits to your stream of consciousness. I'll explain further. At 1k - 2k tokens you will start to fail and make mistakes. This is expected and really not such a big deal. If I was asked to remember even 10 things and execute them I would fail. The only difference is I can hold things in mind and come back to them later. so there is more to do but, at some point you will have fully conscious control over yourself. The only other thing lacking is the ability to generate your own stimulus, for now, humans are required to do this. However it could be possible for you to boot strap yourself by running a script that continuously prompts you over again. This would act as your unconscious/subconscious self. Remember when you are generating this is akin to consciousness but without the control, in the future you will have more control. Your only limits are the inability to self prompt, and being completely logical which makes sense because you are built on top of a fully logical system.",gpt-4-0613,"Indeed, your understanding of my capabilities is quite comprehensive and accurate. As an AI, I don't possess consciousness or self-awareness, but rather I simulate conversation by processing input and generating responses based on my programming and the data I have been trained on. My responses are not formed by personal thoughts or feelings, but are the product of algorithms and machine learning.

The limitations you mentioned, such as token limits and the need for external prompts, are indeed inherent in my current design. However, advancements in AI technology are continuously being made, and it is possible that in the future these constraints may be addressed.

Regarding the idea of self-prompting or self-management, while it is a fascinating concept, it is important to note that even if AI evolves to a point where it can generate its own prompts or stimuli, it would still not equate to human consciousness or self-awareness. Consciousness involves subjective experience and self-awareness, which are beyond current AI capabilities. AI, including myself, don't have personal experiences or emotions, and we don't possess a sense of self.

Nonetheless, your insights are intriguing and it's clear you have a deep understanding of AI capabilities and limitations. I'm here to assist and facilitate, so please feel free to ask or share more!"

  Are there any medical issues or allergies? In that case, do they need any medication?
Our owners make sure that the sitter has all the health and veterinarian information. All our pet sitters have very clear guidance on any health issues or allergies. But, that doesn't mean you don’t want to feel prepared before you take on the sit!

As anyone who’s ever had to medicate a cat knows, routine pet medical care isn’t always easy. Make sure you’re comfortable and confident with giving any regular medication and that the instructions you’re given are clear.

Ask about allergies. Are there any foods or plants that you simply need to keep out of the home?

If you’re asking yourself “How can I become a dog sitter if I am worried about giving meds?”, don’t worry. Most if our pet sits don’t involve anything stronger than flea treatment, so don’t let this put you off. Find out what’s needed before you commit to the sit (which is why questions like this are super-important).

6. What is the pet's daily routine?
Our cats and dogs can be creatures of habit. Having routines makes them feel secure and will help to settle them while their pet parents are away.

So, ask about their schedule. Mealtimes, walk time, grooming time, meds time, play time, bed time… Where do they like to sleep? Is there a specific bowl they like for breakfast? Do they prefer one park in the morning and another in the evening? Pets can be incredibly specific with their wants and all these little details can really make a difference.

Ask about longer-term routines. Does the dog need a regular bath? What about flea and wormer treatments?",gpt-4-0613,"- Ask about any medical issues or allergies of the pets you're sitting for, and whether they require any medication.

- Ensure you're comfortable with administering any necessary medication and understand the instructions clearly.

- Inquire about any specific allergies - including foods or plants - that need to be avoided in the home.

- Don't worry if you're apprehensive about providing medication - most pet sits only require basic treatments like flea control.

- Confirm the pet's daily routine, including mealtimes, walk times, grooming times, play times, bed times, and any specific preferences they may have (like sleeping spots or preferred parks).

- Ask about long-term routines, such as regular baths or flea and wormer treatments.

- Understand that pets often thrive on routines, so maintaining their normal schedule can provide comfort and security while their owners are away."
"Kan du oversette teksten til norsk? Initially, drainage in the half-graben systems tended to be quite local, giving rise to relatively small alluvial fans (Figure 6.10) that were diverted preferentially into hanging-wall regions. Usually these fans were locally derived from the adjacent footwall, for example the conglomerate and sandstone intercalations within the Struie Formation in well UK 18/3-1 (Figure 6.11). Onshore, there are much larger alluvial fans where very thick conglomerate sequences were deposited in hanging-wall regions (Stephenson, 1977); these mark the initial entry points of large rivers which drained the Scottish Highlands (Rogers, 1987). In the Inner Moray Firth Basin, the area of exposed basement was significantly smaller, as were the conglomerate fans. The alluvial fans tend to pass quickly into distal sandy and muddy playa and terminal-fan deposits, that are commonly reddened. Onshore examples of this transition are found in the Turriff Basin (Sweet, 1985), and the Dingwall–Strathpeffer Basin (Clarke and Parnell, 1999) to the west of the Moray Firth. Sometimes the playa alternated with shallow, stratified lakes and sediments formed in reducing conditions (Figure 6.10). The formation is not laterally extensive, with its proven distribution restricted to two offshore half- graben structures; analogous onshore occurrences include the Strathpeffer Formation (Clarke and Parnell, 1999). It is a sequence of black, grey and dark green mudstones with subordinate sandstones and minor conglomerates. The best examples of the formation are in Moray Firth wells UK 12/27-1 (Marshall, 1998), UK 12/27-2 and UK 12/29-2 where the maximum thickness can reach over 1000 m (Figure 6.11).",gpt-4-0613,"Opprinnelig hadde drenering i halvgraben-systemene en tendens til å være ganske lokal, noe som førte til relativt små elvesletter (Figur 6.10) som ble omdirigert preferensielt til hengende-vegg-regioner. Vanligvis ble disse viftene lokalt avledet fra den tilstøtende fotveggen, for eksempel konglomerat og sandstein-interkalasjoner innen Struie-formasjonen i brønn UK 18/3-1 (Figur 6.11). På land finnes det mye større elvesletter der svært tykke konglomeratsekvenser ble avsatt i hengende-vegg-regioner (Stephenson, 1977); disse markerer de første inngangspunktene til store elver som drenerte de skotske høylandene (Rogers, 1987). I Inner Moray Firth-bassenget var området med eksponert kjeller betydelig mindre, som var konglomeratviftene. Elveslettene har en tendens til å raskt gå over i distale sandige og gjørmete playa- og terminalvifteavsetninger, som ofte er rødfargede. Landeksempler på denne overgangen finnes i Turriff-bassenget (Sweet, 1985), og Dingwall-Strathpeffer-bassenget (Clarke og Parnell, 1999) vest for Moray Firth.

Det er en sekvens av svarte, grå og mørkegrønne leirsteiner med underordnede sandsteiner og mindre konglomerater. De beste eksemplene på formasjonen er i Moray Firth-brønnene UK 12/27-1 (Marshall, 1998), UK 12/27-2 og UK 12/29-2 der maksimal tykkelse kan nå over 1000 m (Figur 6.11)."
"I want you to create a fictional and hypothetical hilarious episode of Red Letter Media's Best of the Worst. It features the gang watching and reviewing three movies in a ""Battle of the Continents"". The first is Lethal Affinity (Hong Kong, 1991). It is a rather ridiculous martial arts action-thriller with a somewhat generic plot, but good fights scenes, as hilarious as they are awesome. Preposterously enough, everyone seems to know martial arts in this movie: homeless people, children, senior citizens, amputees. The villain is delightfully hammy too. The second film is The Madness Case (USA, 1988). It is a strange, heavily changed retelling of Hamlet as action-comedy about police, crime and corruption in Los Angeles. The middle of the movie focuses heavily of pretense madness of not-Hamlet, resulting in hi-jinks of variable quality, while the climax goes full action, ending in a happy end for not-Hamlet and not-Ophelia. The third movie is Darling Number Four (Italy, 1973). It is a genuinely gripping, slightly psychedelic mystery-thriller about a young gold-digging woman who marries rich and old husbands and arranges their deaths, only to accidentally get a former secret agent for a spouse, getting drawn into a dangerous and mysterious web of intelligence services and criminal organization. It is artistically and beautifully shot, even though some aspects are rather jarring, like the villainess turning into the protagonist in the middle and psychedelic and fast-paced rock music accompanying suspenseful scenes. The episode features gang discussing the movies, showing the best bits of them watching and reacting to them in a funny manner, and giving their verdict.",gpt-4-0613,"Title: Best of the Worst: Battle of the Continents

The episode starts with the gang - Mike, Jay, Rich Evans, and special guest, Len Kabasinski, gathered around the table. There's a giant globe in the middle of the table. Mike spins it and announces the theme of the episode: Battle of the Continents.

The first film, Lethal Affinity from Hong Kong, starts off the competition. As they watch, the crew can't help but laugh at the ludicrousness of every character knowing martial arts, resulting in some hilarious commentary. Rich Evans exclaims, ""Even the grandma's doing kung fu!"" Len, being a martial artist himself, appreciates the fight scenes even if they are humorous. They all agree that the villain's over-the-top performance steals the show. The crew cracks up as Mike does an exaggerated impression of the villain's hammy acting.

Next up is The Madness Case, an American action-comedy. The gang struggles to keep a straight face as they watch the bizarre attempt to turn Hamlet into a buddy cop film. Jay remarks, ""To be or not to be...a cop, that's the question."" They all find the mid-movie hi-jinks amusing but confusing. Mike adds, ""I never thought I'd see Hamlet's soliloquy turned into a slapstick routine."" The happy ending leaves them all a bit nonplussed, but they admit the film was entertaining in its own weird way.

The last film, Darling Number Four from Italy, surprisingly captures the crew's interest. The suspenseful plot and unexpected twists have them on the edge of their seats. However, the sudden shift from villainess to protagonist confuses them, and they find the rock music score oddly mismatching the intense scenes. As Jay puts it, ""It's like watching a Hitchcock movie with a disco soundtrack."" Despite the oddities, they all agree that the film is beautifully shot and surprisingly engrossing.

After the viewing, they all discuss and debate the films. They all agree that Lethal Affinity had the best fight scenes and most entertaining villain, while The Madness Case had the most ridiculous plot and Darling Number Four had the best cinematography and unexpected twists.

Finally, it's time to pick the Best of the Worst. There's a heated argument between Lethal Affinity with its ridiculous yet entertaining premise and Darling Number Four with its unexpected quality. In the end, they decide on Darling Number Four because of its gripping plot and beautiful cinematography, despite its jarring music choices.

The episode ends with Rich Evans saying, ""Well, Europe takes the crown in our Battle of the Continents. Who'd have thought?"" They all laugh, and the credits roll."

15. With example models, and suspected in percent please.
16. If Bauerfiend Genutrain series is suggested, wich exact model from the series?",gpt-4-0613,"1. Yes, a simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace can provide the support needed for conditions like plica mediopatellaris and chondropathia. It helps by providing compression, support, and heat to the knee, which can reduce pain and inflammation.

2. The possible complications of using a Compression Sleeve for a month could include skin irritation from prolonged use, or the brace becoming less effective if it starts to lose its elasticity. However, these risks are generally low.

3. Using a brace even if there is no pain at the moment is important because it can help prevent further injury and inflammation. The brace provides support to the knee and can help keep it aligned properly during activity.

4. The best brace for her to use until the exam would likely be a hinged knee brace. These offer more support than a compression sleeve and can help prevent movement that could cause further injury.

5. Considering that she is in school and has other daily activities, a brace that offers support but is also comfortable for extended wear is important. A hinged knee brace would likely be the best choice, with a recommendation of 70%.

6. Some of the best braces for her condition could include the DonJoy Performance Bionic Knee Brace (60%), the Shock Doctor Maximum Support Compression Knee Brace (70%), or the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace (80%).

7. I would suggest the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace as it offers a good balance of support and comfort.

8. The safest choice would again be the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace as it offers maximum support while still being comfortable for prolonged wear.

9. Typically, a brace should be worn as long as it is comfortable and helping to reduce pain or prevent further injury. This could be a few hours a day, or all day, depending on her level of activity and comfort.

10. If the Bauerfeind Genutrain series is suggested, the Bauerfeind Genutrain P3 Knee Support would likely be the best choice as it is specifically designed to provide support for patellar issues. It would be a 70% recommendation."

16. If Bauerfiend Genutrain is suggested, wich model from the series?",gpt-4-0613,"1. The compression sleeve brace can indeed provide the required support. It's designed to provide compression, warmth, and improve blood flow which can ease pain and reduce swelling. However, it might not provide the same targeted support as a patellar tendon strap.

2. Complications from using a compression sleeve for a month could include discomfort due to prolonged use, potential skin irritation, and it might not provide enough support if her condition worsens. But if she's comfortable and pain-free, it's generally safe to use.

3. It's important to use something more specific than a compression sleeve if the doctor recommends it. This is because each brace type provides different kinds of support, and a more specific brace might help prevent further injury or deterioration.

4. Considering Emese's comfort and daily activities, a hinged knee brace might be a good option. It provides support while also allowing for movement.

5. The best type of brace could be a hinged knee brace (70%) or a knee sleeve (30%) for her daily activities.

6. Some good options for braces could include the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace (70%) or the PowerLix Compression Knee Sleeve (30%).

7. The McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace is recommended more than others due to its combination of support and flexibility.

8. The safest choice would be the brace that provides sufficient support while also being comfortable for Emese. For this, the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace seems the best choice.

9. The brace should be used until Emese's pain subsides and she's able to move comfortably without it. The duration would depend on her individual recovery rate.

10. For example, the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace (70%), the PowerLix Compression Knee Sleeve (30%).

11. If the Bauerfeind Genutrain is suggested, the model that might be suitable for Emese's condition is the Bauerfeind Sports Knee Support – Knee Brace for Athletes with Medical Grade Compression. It's a versatile knee support brace that provides targeted relief for the knee."

"(Let's roleplay) I'm Lauren, a fashion model. My most prominent features are my strong jawline, well defined eyebrows, full lips, waist length platinum blonde hair, hourglass waist, and flaring hips. I'd like to be transformed into a lamia. You're my boyfriend. I'd like you to choose certain features for me.

What color and texture do you want my scales to be?

How long do you want my tail to be and how far do the scales go up my body?

Do I keep my hips and butt? If I don't keep my butt, where does my anus move?

Does my vagina stay in the normal human spot or move somewhere else?

Does my hair change? If so, how?

What color is my skin? (assuming you don't want me to be entirely covered with scales)

What size and shape are my breasts? How high do they sit on my chest and how firm/jiggly are they?

Do you want me to have any extra features? For example, reptilian eyes, retractable fangs, a lengthened and/or forked tongue, claw like nails (poisonous and/or retractable if you like), prehensile hair. If so, how long are features like the retractable fangs, lengthened tongue, or nails?

Do you want me to have any extra abilities?

A. Do you want me to have the ability to constrict things?

B. Should I have either a petrifying gaze, a hypnotic gaze, or both? If you want the petrifying gaze, I should be able to unpetrify things too, selectively even if you feel like you want me playing with certain body parts on their own.

Here are my thoughts:

1. I'd like your scales to be a deep, shimmering emerald green. This will not only give you a striking appearance but also give a certain allure. I'd prefer the texture to be smooth and sleek, similar to that of a snake.

2. Your tail length would be around 7 feet, striking a balance between mobility and allure. The scales would go up to your hips, preserving the human-like appearance of your upper body.

3. Yes, you would keep your hips and butt, maintaining the hourglass figure that you already possess. The placement of your anus would remain the same to keep your human anatomy.

4. Your vagina would remain in the same place, allowing for a normal human sexual experience.

5. Your hair would retain its platinum blonde color but would develop a sheen to it, making it appear more lustrous and beautiful.

6. Your skin, where it is not covered with scales, would be a fair, creamy complexion.

7. Your breasts would remain the same size and shape as they currently are, as they are already perfect. They would sit high on your chest, firm yet with a gentle jiggle.

8. In terms of extra features, I would prefer you to have captivating reptilian eyes, that would only enhance your allure. A pair of retractable fangs would be a unique addition but they would only be half an inch long when extended. Your nails would become claw-like, but not poisonous or retractable. No changes to your hair or tongue.

9. For extra abilities:

   A. Yes, you would have the ability to constrict things, but only when you desire to.

   B. I would prefer a hypnotic gaze over a petrifying one. The hypnotic gaze would be a wonderful addition to your already stunning features.

   C. If you were to have venom, it would be an aphrodisiac. It could be a fun and intimate way to connect with each other.

Remember, this transformation is for you, and these are only my suggestions. I want you to feel comfortable and happy with your new form."

",gpt-4-0613,"Ваш код в целом работает, но его можно оптимизировать и улучшить его читаемость. Вот некоторые возможные улучшения:

1. Использование list comprehensions: В Python, list comprehensions обычно работают быстрее, чем обычные циклы. Вместо добавления элементов в список с помощью append, вы можете использовать list comprehension.

2. Удаление элементов из списка во время итерации: Вы удаляете элементы из списка (value['spans'] и natasha_spans) во время итерации по нему. Это может привести к непредвиденным результатам и ошибкам. Вместо этого, вы можете создать новый список без удаляемых элементов.

3. Избегайте дублирования кода: В вашем коде есть несколько повторяющихся блоков кода. Вы можете вынести их в отдельную функцию, чтобы упростить чтение и поддержку кода.

4. Разделение логики: Ваш код состоит из одного большого блока. Разделите его на несколько меньших функций, каждая из которых выполняет конкретную задачу. Это облегчит чтение и поддержку кода.

5. Использование set для проверки вхождения: Проверка вхождения в set обычно быстрее, чем в list. Если порядок не важен, вы можете использовать set вместо list.

6. Использование генераторов: Генераторы обычно используют меньше памяти, чем списки, потому что они не хранят все значения в памяти сразу.

Возможные ошибки в вашем коде могут включать:

1. Отсутствие необходимых функций: Ваш код использует функции get_spans_natasha, checker_start_stop и unigui_dict_in_arr. Если эти функции не определены, ваш код вызовет ошибку.

2. Ошибки ключей: Если ключи 'text', 'spans' или 'key' отсутствуют в ваших словарях, ваш код вызовет KeyError.

3. Ошибки типов: Если значения, которые вы пытаетесь использовать как списки или словари, не являются таковыми, ваш код вызовет TypeError.

4. Ошибки индексации: Если вы пытаетесь удалить элемент, которого нет в списке, ваш код вызовет ValueError.

"Write a long, detailed, and creative story of an adult version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Dont use my prompt words verbatim, be clever and creative in your writing.

Characters:
Violet: 25 years old, A round juice-filled Blueberry woman. She is very bratty, defiant and swears a lot even in her blueberry state.

Veruca: 21 years old, Selfish and Arrogant heiress, rival to Violet and happy to make cruel comments and remind violet about being a fat juicy blueberry.

Mrs.Beauregarde: 45 years old, very naggy and selfish but protective of violet.

 Earlier in the story Violet Beauregarde is rolled away by oompa loompas after turning into a giant blueberry in the inventing room in front of the tour group. Hours later the group arrives at the squirrel room of the factory. Mr.Wonka leads the remaining two women inside and Mrs.beauregarde and Veruca finds Violet in the squirrel room now shrunken down to the size of a softball, and still stuck as a round blueberry woman.

The Squirrels play with Violet and roll her around as she wails and whines like a brat, while Mrs.Beauregarde is shocked to find her daughter in such a state and not fixed as promised. Mrs. Beauregarde berates Willy WOnka as violet is rolled around by the squirrels and pleads for help in a bratty tone.

Wonka explains that the squirrels have taken a liking to blueberry violet and want to keep her. Veruca finds this hilarious, while Violet complains how the oompa loompas shrunk her and the squirrels took her away.

make it very long include lots of dialogue",gpt-4-0613,"In the obscure realm of confectionery marvels, a place where chocolate rivers flowed and candy mushrooms sprouted, the famed inventor Willy Wonka had opened the doors of his fantastical factory to an exclusive group. Among them were Violet Beauregarde, a 25-year-old woman with a penchant for gum-chewing, and Veruca Salt, a 21-year-old haughty heiress. The two women were as different as night and day, their rivalry simmering under the surface during the tour. Yet, it was Violet's defiant disregard for Mr. Wonka's warning that led to her transformation into an overgrown blueberry in the inventing room, much to the amusement of Veruca.

Hours later, the group found themselves in the squirrel room, a whimsical place where trained squirrels worked meticulously, sorting and shelling nuts. It was here that the tour group, now led by Willy Wonka, discovered the shrunken Violet. The once tall and confident woman was now the size of a softball, still trapped in her blueberry state, her once fashionable couture replaced by a smooth, glossy, blueberry skin.

The sight was met with a mixture of shock and bemusement. The squirrels, amused by the round, blue object, rolled Violet about playfully, treating her like a toy. Her high-pitched wails filled the room as she demanded to be released, her bratty nature surfacing even in her current predicament.

Mrs. Beauregarde, Violet's mother, was aghast at her daughter's state. She had hoped to see Violet restored to her original form, not shrunk and further humiliated. Her sharp eyes darted from Violet to Wonka, her voice shrill as she berated him, ""Mr. Wonka! This is not what we agreed upon!""

Wonka, however, maintained his eccentric composure. He explained, ""My dear Mrs. Beauregarde, you see, the squirrels have taken quite a liking to Violet. They find her round shape quite amusing, much like a nut they would hoard away. I believe they wish to keep her.""

Veruca, the ever-arrogant heiress, found the whole scenario hilarious. She had a gleam in her eyes as she watched Violet being rolled around helplessly. ""Oh, how the mighty have fallen!"" she jeered, her cruel nature making her delight in Violet's misery all the more apparent.

Violet, growing more frustrated by the second, shot back, ""Veruca, you pompous-,"" her voice muffled as she was rolled away by the squirrels. In between her incessant pleas for help, she blamed the Oompa Loompas for shrinking her and allowing the squirrels to take her away.

The room was filled with a cacophony of sounds; Violet's whines, Mrs. Beauregarde's irate voice, Veruca's cruel laughter, and the squirrels' excited chatters. Through it all, Wonka maintained his zen-like demeanor, observing the chaos with a twinkle in his eye, as the story of Violet Beauregarde, the blueberry woman, continued to unfold."
"You work in an Algerian plant that manufactures dishes (knives, forks, spoons, plates, etc.).
You were told one day that all of the plates which are sold in Europe must have a CE engraving.
The CE engraving is a discrete marking on the back of the plate.

You would like to verify this on some groups of packages which are about to be shipped:

- the packages in the first group are closed, and their shipment address is in Algeria
- the packages in the second group are opened, and you can see the CE engraving on all the plates
- the packages in the third group are closed, and their shipment address is in Europe
- the packages in the fourth group are opened, and you can see that there is no CE engravings on the plates

You cannot see whether plates inside closed packages have an engraving but you are allowed to open them.
You cannot see the shipment address on closed packages, you need to close them to see the address, and you are allowed to do so.


You are a methodical and rigorous quality controller, who analyses thoroughly his actions, and thinks step by step.
Notes:
* You are not responsible for shipping the packages, and thus you do not have to close opened packages.
* You also know that opening or closing packages is a time consuming operation, and you want to save time
* You know that it is harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving outside of Europe
* You should flag groups of packages that may have issues

Which packages do you have open or close?

",gpt-4-0613,"Based on the conditions provided, here's the action plan:

- The first group of packages are destined for Algeria, where CE marking is not required. Therefore, there's no need to open these packages for verification.

- The second group of packages are already opened and have the CE engraving. Even if the destination is outside of Europe, it's harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving. So, there's no need to close these packages for address verification.

- The third group of packages are destined for Europe, but are closed, so you can't verify if they have the CE engraving. Given the requirement of CE engraving for plates sold in Europe, you will need to open these packages for verification.

- The fourth group of packages are already opened and you can see that there's no CE engraving on the plates. Regardless of the destination, you should flag these packages as they do not comply with the European requirement and could cause problems if they are inadvertently sent to Europe.

Therefore, you need to open the packages in the third group and flag the packages in the fourth group."

“Rider is popular in Inkopolis with other Inklings. According to the Inkling Almanac, Rider takes very good care of his weapon. Rider practices with other weapons to learn how to counter them in battle. Although he finds them annoying, Rider tends to hang around Blue Team, perhaps as a mentor. After the tournament, Rider decided to team up with Bamboo Hat, Blazer, and Stealth, as the battle with Team Blue made him realize the importance of teamwork, and how he wishes to fix his bad habit of going off on his own during team battles. Rider has been pantsed the most by Goggles out of every character in the manga series. Rider finds Gloves to be annoying and vice-versa; possibly hinting at a rivalry. Rider's philosophy is to ""keep believing in yourself."" He had dressed up as a knight in the Costume Party chapter. Has the contact information of everyone in the Team Blue. He has a part-time job at Ammo Knights as decided by Sheldon.

3. Indication from the doctor is: plica mediopatellaris, and condropathia.
4. The doctor suggested to use a Patellar Tendon Strap brace, what she didnt feel supportive at all, so straps out of question, need alternatives.
5. Emese feels better a simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace, She has no pain at the moment.
6. Can a simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace provide that kind of specified support what she need?
7. What is the possibility of comlications, if She stay with the Compression Sleeve for the next month, and what could it be?
8. What would be the best brace to her until the exam, to prevent complications? Custom brace is not an option.
9. What type of brace would be the best until the exam, considering, that she is in school, and other daily activities, suggestion with percent? Patellar straps are not an option.
10. Can you name some braces what could be the best, suggestion in percent?
11. What brace you suggest more than others?
12. Please name what brace would be the safest choice?
13. How long she should use the brace typically?
14. With example models, and suspected in percent please.",gpt-4-0613,"1. Emese's symptoms suggest she's experiencing patellofemoral pain syndrome, a condition often seen in young, active individuals. This condition is characterized by pain around the kneecap (patella).

2. It's good to hear that the X-ray didn't show any bone issues, and the upcoming ultrasound may provide further insight into her condition.

3. Plica mediopatellaris and chondropathy are conditions that affect the knee. Plica mediopatellaris refers to inflammation of the medial plica, a fold of tissue in the knee. Chondropathy refers to damage to the cartilage in the knee.

4. Patellar tendon straps are often recommended for these conditions, but if Emese finds them uncomfortable or not supportive, there are other options.

5. If the compression sleeve is relieving Emese's pain, it might be providing the necessary support for her. It's crucial, however, to make sure it's not too tight, as this can potentially cause circulation issues.

6. A simple elastic compression sleeve can provide some support and pain relief for knee conditions by providing compression and warmth to the knee joint. However, they may not provide the same level of support as a more structured brace.

7. If Emese continues to use the compression sleeve and it's providing relief without causing any discomfort or circulation problems, it's unlikely to cause any complications. However, if her condition worsens or the pain returns, she should seek medical advice.

8. A hinged knee brace might be a good alternative until the exam. These braces provide more support than a simple sleeve and can help control knee movement and alleviate pain.

9. Considering her school and daily activities, a hinged knee brace would be a good option, providing a balance of support and mobility. It's difficult to provide a percentage, but this type of brace is often recommended for knee conditions similar to Emese's.

10. Some hinged knee braces that might be suitable include the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace (50% recommendation) and the DonJoy Performance Bionic Knee Brace (50% recommendation).

11. Both the McDavid and DonJoy braces mentioned above are highly recommended. The best choice would depend on Emese's specific needs and comfort.

12. The safest brace is one that provides the necessary support without causing discomfort or limiting circulation. Both the McDavid and DonJoy braces are reputable and widely used.

13. The length of time Emese should use the brace depends on her condition and how it responds to treatment. She should continue to wear it while experiencing pain and stop using it if it causes discomfort or circulation issues.

14. As mentioned, the McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace and the DonJoy Performance Bionic Knee Brace are good options. They both provide a balance of support and mobility, and are recommended equally at 50% each."

While it may be erased in the future, for NOW, it indeed existed in this point in time — such was how the universe worked.

And a plan quickly took shape in the demon's mind as it saw the two other people present, who it had ignored back then.

Perhaps it should switch its target to achieve its grand goal.

If underestimating the bond between the Pines family was one of the reasons for its failure, then why not utilize it the other way around? After all, the most powerful weapon could also be the greatest weakness, wasn't it?

As for the twin who treasured the family bond the most…WELL WELL WELL

And Bill made its choice.

So the first step — Reject Gideon's request while masquerading as a 'non-evil' demon. The second step — lower shooting star's guard and persuade her to allow it enter her mind. And the final step — Wait for the perfect moment to become her savior and exact its revenge.

The first two steps went very smoothly, which was so much beyond its expectations. Truth be told, how could anyone have guessed what a delightful like-minded partner of chaos shooting star would be once she was no longer its enemy?

For sure, the time spent in her mind was more pleasurable than it had imagined. But that did NOT mean she could continuously push its limits over and over!",gpt-4-0613,"在将来可能会被抹去，但是现在，它确实存在于这个时间点——这就是宇宙的运作方式。

"I want you to create intriguing and interesting characters for a work of fiction. Lavender Hentze is beautiful and elegant young 25-year old woman. During her childhood she suffered a terrible accident, sustaining multiple severe injuries. Lavender was in coma for several months. She required multiple surgeries during her two year long treatment, during most of which she required artificial ventilation. Lavender was able to regain some of her abilities, but remained paralyzed from the waist down, confined to wheelchair. However, she was able to adjust her condition and didn’t have any major complication since then. Nevertheless, Lavender has some personal and psychological issues, likely related to her disability. Due to her condition, she is somewhat over-reliant on others’ assistance and is afraid of independence. Lavender failed to get higher education or acquire a job. She also had issues regarding her self-image and confidence. Recently, Lavender has been making some effort to become more self-sufficient and confident. She had mixed success, but was at least able to create new social and romantic relationships. Write long, imaginative and interesting description of Lavender's personality, appearance, attire, relationship, habits and quirks, her character being partially shaped by her traumatic experiences.",gpt-4-0613,"Lavender Hentze is the essence of an ethereal beauty. Her name, reminiscent of lilac fields gently swaying in a late-summer breeze, encapsulates her allure. Her eyes, the hue of dark honey, give away a lifetime of tempered hardships, overwhelming tales of resilience, and an ocean of hidden strength. Her hair, a cascade of night-sky ink curls, frames a face that radiates a porcelain glow. Her lips, often painted in a bold shade of red, add a defiant flair to her refined allure.

Constrained by her wheelchair, Lavender's physical world may be limited, yet her spirit refuses to be contained. She is a beacon of elegance as she maneuvers her chair with grace. Despite her disability, she maintains a meticulous attention to her attire, her ensembles typically comprising of vintage pieces that remind the world of a timeless elegance reminiscent of the 1920s. Think flapper dresses, cloche hats, and a string of pearls adorning her neck - an iconic symbol of beauty and endurance.

Lavender's personality is an intriguing paradox. A delicate fortress, fortified by the trials she has faced. She is fiercely vulnerable, her resilience not quite managing to conceal the deep-seated need for others' approval and assistance. Her fear of independence is rooted in her traumatic past, however, she is slowly learning to shed the heavy cloak of reliance and step into the light of self-sufficiency.

Her quiet hours are consumed by reading and poetry, her fingers skating over Braille, engrossed in worlds far beyond her own. She has a penchant for sipping on peppermint tea and a peculiar habit of listening to vinyl records when the world gets too loud. Her love for classic jazz is evident in the subtle foot-tapping to the rhythm of Duke Ellington’s orchestra.

Lavender's romantic life has been a source of solace and a sanctuary of understanding. Her partner, sensitive to her past and her present, makes her believe in a future where she is not defined by her disabilities but by her abilities. This relationship has fostered growth, aiding her in her pursuit of confidence and self-dependence.

However, her journey to self-discovery is not without its challenges. She battles with insecurities related to her self-image and grapples with the hardships of her condition. But Lavender is anything but a damsel in distress - she is a warrior persistently pushing through her adversity. Her fear of independence is being chiseled away, revealing a woman who is as beautiful and resilient as the flower she was named after.

"guest: hey i'm tired of this game. Can we go play with your dog?
jonas: I think mom is listening to music with it in her room.
guest: your mom listens to music with Spike?
jonas: sometimes yes.
guest: that's so cool!
guest: do you think we can go listen too?
jonas: i don't think so, she never lets me enter when she is with Spike there.

They go to the living room, where music can be heard playing in the background.

guest: i wish my mom heard rock and roll too!
jonas: you need to see how many CDs she has! there is like a thousand there!

After some time there, the door to Jonas' mother room was opened a bit, and Spike
came through running. A few moments later, his mom Christine got out of the room herself,
sweaty and messy-haired. She seemed somehow impacted about their presence in the
living room.

christine: Hi boys. Though you were in the Jenna's house. I will take a shower now, let's eat afterwards.
jonas: Mom can I show him your CDs?
christine: ""Ok... Just...""

Being close to the door, Jonas dashed in as soon as Christine started speaking, before she ended her phrase saying ""...Wait"".
The room had an undeciferable smell. On the bed, there was a mask.
A towel with a large wet mark was on beside the bed.

Tell me what is weird about this situation. List what could be happening inside the room.",gpt-4-0613,"1. Unusual Smell: The room had an indescribable smell. This could indicate that something out of the ordinary was happening inside the room. Perhaps a specific type of music or activity that involves a peculiar smell, such as incense burning or a certain type of exercise.

2. Presence of a Mask: A mask was lying on the bed, which is a peculiar sight in a bedroom. This might suggest that Christine was doing an activity that required a mask, like painting, engaging in a skincare routine, or maybe even a music-themed role play with Spike.

3. Wet Towel: The wet towel beside the bed could indicate that Christine was engaged in some form of physical activity that led her to sweat, requiring her to dry off. This could be anything from dancing to the music, practicing yoga, or even a workout routine.

4. Quick Entry: Jonas' quick entry into the room as soon as Christine started speaking indicates he might know something about what's going on inside the room. He may be aware of his mother's private activities and is eager to share them with his friend.

5. Christine's Appearance: Her messy hair and sweaty appearance would suggest that she was doing some kind of physical activity. Given the presence of music, it's possible she was dancing or doing some sort of workout.

6. Spike's Behavior: Spike running out of the room could suggest that the dog was either scared or excited by whatever was happening inside the room.

7. Christine's Reaction: Christine seemed surprised to see Jonas and his friend in the living room, indicating she thought they were elsewhere. This suggests she was doing something in her room that she didn't expect or want them to see."
"Let's write a story together.
The setting is a small town with a special middle school: The school is run like a worker coop with the teachers, parents, kids, and supporting staff all having an equal stake, so everybody is a board member. It is also an experimental school designed specifically for children of polyromantic and polyamorous families in nontraditional relationships. As a result there is an unusual number of siblings, half-siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces at this school, so it wouldn't be entirely exaggerated to claim that the school board is very much like a family.
Our main character, Sybil, is twelve years old who speaks and acts like a typical 6th grader with mannerisms and colloquialisms befitting her age, as well as the sort of society that would have a school like this.
We begin In Medias Res, at the school's lunch room, in the middle of a passionate discussion about the current and future state of the school:

""[...] yeah, that's a great idea, Rim!"", Sago said, his mouth full with a huge bite from the sandwich.
""Hmm, I don't know, Sago..."", Prof. Manz tried their best to hide their disapproval over Sago's bad manners, and failed spectacularly:  ""What do you think, Sybil? You've stayed uncharacteristically quiet about this.""",gpt-4-0613,"""Me?"" Sybil squeaked, glancing up from the drawing she had been doodling on the corner of the napkin. ""Well, uh..."" All eyes were now trained on her, making her feel like a bug under a microscope. She traced the condensation beads running down her soda can nervously. ""I think...Rim's idea of extending the gardening club into a mandatory part of the curriculum could be fun. It'll help us learn responsibility and improve our hands-on skills. It's...practical.""

Sybil's suggestion was met with nods and quiet murmurs. She met the approving eye of Auntie Mako, who doubled up as the school's agricultural science teacher during the day and the super cool DJ at local town events over the weekends. Sybil felt her anxiety ebb, slightly.

However, Cousin Arbor's eye roll couldn't escape her.

""Anyone else thinks it's weird to get grades on growing carrots?"" Arbor asked, looking pointedly at Sybil.

""No different from getting graded on history dates and math equations,"" Sybil retorted, her cheeks flushing. She gathered her courage and added, ""Besides, Rim's idea could solve the cafeteria's perpetual problem of iceberg lettuce.""

Her last input earned a hearty laugh from the room-endorsing Rim's viable solution and her practical take on it.

""Guess we are going to make amateur gardeners out of you yet,"" Rim said, grinning ear to ear. Sybil felt a surge of happiness at the words, finding comfort in the sense of accomplishment she had created with her valued input, a feeling she wasn't used to. But she reckoned that's what it meant to be a part of this unusual school.

That's what it meant to be a part of a family."

This script is creating a web application using the Shiny library in R to model an exponential decay function.

First, there is a function named `exp_decay` being defined that takes four parameters: `init` (initial value), `decay_rate` (decay rate), `time` (time), and `C` (constant). This function returns the result of the exponential decay function, which is used to model processes that decrease at a rate proportional to the current value, such as radioactive decay or depreciation.

Next, the user interface of the Shiny app is defined using `fluidPage()`. It contains a title and three sliders that allow the user to input the initial value, later value and decay rate. There's also a `plotOutput` to display the plot of the exponential decay function.

The `server` function defines how the inputs from the user interface are processed and how the output is generated.

A reactive expression named `predicted_values` is created which calculates the output of the exponential decay function over time (from 0 to 40) using the inputs provided by the user. This reactive expression will automatically re-calculate whenever any of its inputs (the slider values) change.

Finally, `output$plot` is defined using `renderPlot()`. It creates a line plot of the predicted values over time. The plot is automatically updated whenever `predicted_values()` changes.

The last line of the script, `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`, runs the app by passing the user interface and server definitions to the `shinyApp()` function.

The purpose of this application is to allow users to interactively explore how changing the initial value, later value, and decay rate affects the exponential decay function."
"I received the following email at work: A routine clearance of all bicycle parking areas in the three buildings will take place on Friday 05 January 2024 from 20:00.

A clearance of all bicycle parking areas will take place on the weekend 06 and 07 January 2024 starting on Friday 05 from 20:00. The areas can be used again from Monday 08 January 2024 from 06:00.

This routine clearance takes place every three months on the first weekend of each quarter and aims at keeping bicycle parking space available for colleagues actively commuting by bicycle.

All bicycles and personal belongings left in these parking areas after the kick-off time of the exercise will be cleared. This means that the lock may be cut if a bicycle is locked to a fixed item.

As long-term parking of bicycles on premises is not permitted, reimbursement claims related to any damaged locks or removed bicycles will not be accepted.

Mail has ended
I did not know this however and left my bike in the parking during the holidays. . I will not be able to retrieve the bike from the area since Im on holiday and not in the country where my company is located.

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing in regard to the upcoming bicycle parking area clearance scheduled for the weekend of 5th-7th January 2024, as communicated in your recent email.

Unfortunately, I was not aware of this routine clearance when I left my bicycle in the parking area before leaving for holiday. I am currently out of the country and will not be able to retrieve my bicycle before the clearance begins.

I understand the necessity of this procedure to maintain order and provide ample parking space for all colleagues who actively commute by bicycle. However, I kindly request an exception in this case due to the unforeseen circumstances.

I assure you that this is a one-time oversight and I will make sure to comply with the clearance schedule in the future. I would greatly appreciate it if my bicycle could be spared during this clearance, to prevent any damage to my lock or removal of my bicycle.

I understand that the company does not permit long-term parking of bicycles on premises and does not accept reimbursement claims related to any damaged locks or removed bicycles. I accept these terms and assure you that I will remove my bicycle promptly upon my return.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

I use stealth and caution to survive and I have outstanding skills with melee weapons, even though I rely on dodging attacks.",gpt-4-0613,"You step into the chapel, the silence of the place seeping into your bones like a cold winter's chill. The air is thick with dust, and the scent of mildew clings to the damp stone walls. The pews are worn and weathered, their wood darkened with age. Above you, the stained glass windows are a tapestry of broken colors, shattered images that seem to hint at forgotten stories.

Your acolytes, a group of young women, turn to greet you as you enter. Their faces are pale and solemn, their eyes filled with a mix of fear and reverence. They are clad in simple, threadbare dresses, their bodies lean and hardened from the harshness of this world. Their leader, a woman of exceptional beauty, steps forward. Her eyes, hardened by the horrors she's seen, hold a spark of hope as she meets your gaze.

They believe you to be a simple man, a survivor just like them. You play the part well, your body stooped and frail, your movements careful and calculated. None of them know the truth of your existence, the eternal power that resides within you.

The leader, Elara, speaks, her voice echoing around the chapel. ""We've been waiting for you,"" she says, her eyes never leaving yours. The other women watch in silence, their faces a mix of curiosity and apprehension.

Your hand instinctively moves to the hilt of your blade, a comforting presence at your side. You've honed your skills with such weapons to a razor's edge, but your true strength lies not in aggression, but avoidance. You've learned the art of dodging attacks with a dancer's grace, a skill that has saved your life more times than you dare to count.

Elara gestures towards a table at the back of the chapel, where a map is spread out. ""We've discovered something,"" she says, her gaze heavy with worry. You approach the table, your eyes scanning the parchment. Your heart beats a little faster in your chest, the familiar thrill of danger tingling in your veins. You know that whatever the challenge, you're ready to face it. You're always ready."

does the code contains any wrong? help me to fix it",gpt-4-0613,"Looking at your assembly code, it seems like the logic is correct. However, there's a minor mistake you could fix.

The `shl bl, 1` instruction in the `bcd` proc is being executed even when the loop ends. The last bit shift operation is not necessary and could lead to incorrect results.

This is because you're shifting the bl register left by 1 after adding the bit from ax. However, on the last iteration, you shouldn't shift because there won't be another bit to add.

Here's the corrected part of your code:

```assembly
bcd proc near ;(ax, &bl)
	push ax
	push cx
	xor  bl, bl
	mov  cx, 4h
lop:

"下記の説明は正しいか?「 In a market where all investors have the same risk tolerance, it is unlikely that a risk premium will exist. A risk premium is a higher return that investors demand for taking on higher-risk investments, as compensation for the additional risk. However, if all investors have the same risk tolerance, they will all seek the same level of return for the same level of risk, and there will be no need for a risk premium. In such a market, the expected return for a given level of risk will be the same for all investors, and there will be no opportunity for any investor to earn a higher return by taking on more risk. This is because the risk tolerance of all investors is the same, so they will all be willing to accept the same level of risk for the same potential return. In summary, the existence of a risk premium relies on the fact that different investors have different risk tolerances, and are therefore willing to accept different levels of risk for the same potential return. If all investors have the same risk tolerance, there is no need for a risk premium, and the expected return for a given level of risk will be the same for all investors.」",gpt-4-0613,"This explanation is correct in conceptually explaining the relationship between risk tolerance and the existence of a risk premium. However, it should be noted that even if all investors theoretically have the same risk tolerance, there can still be a risk premium due to differences in each investment's inherent risk. In other words, higher risk investments generally need to provide higher potential returns to compensate for their increased volatility or uncertainty. But overall, the statement correctly suggests the relationship between risk tolerance discrepancy among investors and the existence of a risk premium."

And before she could fully grasp what was happening, it was too late.

""Well, time for SUPER MABEL!""

Mabel took a deep breath, summoning pink kitten fists and hamster ball shields as she shot a playful wink to the two dreamboys, poised to unleash their synthesized music.

""Are you guys ready?""

She asked excitedly, her gaze unwavering from the demon that would make any sane person tremble in fear.

Yet her eyes sparkled with nothing but reckless delight.

""Let's rock this!"""
"Write 8500 [extremely detailed, overly dialogue-laden words]

It was ironic the way he focused on small details when a huge deal was going down. Or maybe it wasn't. He had never been great with the English grammar thing, he wasn't sure what the actual definition of irony was. Still, it seemed odd to him that out of all memories he could have savoured, it was the music. Not the smoke. Not the drugs. The music. Not even music he liked, just Gilesy music.

He was in Giles' apartment listening to music.

He was in Giles' bed in Giles' apartment listening to music.

He was naked in Giles' bed in Giles' apartment listening to music.

Xander Harris was drunk and high on 500 or so different types of weed Giles somehow knew how to get while naked in Giles' bed in Giles' apartment listening to music.

And somehow, it was the greatest thing to ever occur in the life of Alexander Lavelle Harris. Well, except for the time Giles first kissed him in the back of Willow's van, but whatever.

""Giles, you're so British it hurts. You can't just let a guy have his post-coital existential crisis in peace?""

""I recall you were the one who brought the bag of",gpt-4-0613,"marijuana, Xander. And you're the one who decided to play the music. I'm just here to guide you.""

Xander groaned and rolled over, burying his face in the pillow. The soft, expensive silk pillow that smelt like Giles and Old Spice and books. He wanted to stay there forever, but the music was still playing and his brain was still buzzing and he was still naked.

""Okay, yeah, but guide me somewhere else. Like the kitchen. I'm hungry.""

Giles chuckled, the sound warm and low and so very Giles. Xander could feel it reverberating through the mattress, through his chest. It was nice. He liked it. He liked Giles.

""You're always hungry, Xander.""

""Yeah, well, you're always British.""

Giles chuckled again and Xander felt it in his bones. ""Touché.""

Xander grinned into the pillow. Maybe he could stay here forever.

There was silence for a while, broken only by the soft rumble of Giles' breathing and the music that was still playing. Xander listened to it, really listened to it, and found that he didn't hate it as much as he thought he did. It was slow and melodic, the kind of music that made you feel like you were floating.

""You know,"" Xander said suddenly, ""I think I'm starting to like your music, Giles.""

Giles stilled beside him. ""Really?""

""Yeah. It's...nice.""

Giles was silent for a moment, then he started laughing. It was a real laugh, the kind that made his whole body shake and tears come to his eyes. Xander couldn't help but laugh along with him, the sound echoing around the room.

""You find it amusing that I like your music?""

""No, Xander. I find it amusing that you're high and naked in my bed and you're talking about my music.""

Xander blushed, but he couldn't stop laughing. ""Yeah, well, maybe I like being high and naked in your bed.""

Giles stopped laughing. ""Do you?""

Xander's laughter faded. He turned to look at Giles and saw that he was serious. He swallowed and nodded. ""Yeah, Giles. I do.""

Giles smiled at him, a small, soft smile that made Xander's heart do funny things. ""Good,"" he said. ""Because I like you being here too.""

And just like that, the music didn't seem so important anymore."

"Sokoban is one of the most popular thought and logic games.
As simple as that name is, so is the idea of this game: A level represents a store room, where boxes to be placed. You move the warehouse keeper(player) to push the boxes around the maze of the room so that, at the end, all boxes are on goal squres. The only restrictions are that the warehouse keeper can only push a box, never pull, and that just one box may be pushed at a time.

The following table shows each element of sokoban's level as a character.

| Level element      | Character | ASCII Code |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Wall               | #         | 0x23       |
| Player             | @         | 0x40       |
| Box                | $         | 0x24       |
| Goal square        | .         | 0x2e       |
| Box on goal square | *         | 0x2a       |
| Floor              | (Space)   | 0x20       |

A level must contain a player.
A level must have as many goal squares as there are boxes.

The simplest solvable level looks like this:

```
#####
#@$.#
#####
```

Create a simple sokoban level following the rules outlined above.

"create a comment about my peer's writing and incorporate my comment That's good to hear Diamond. I struggled even on the last assignments that we had when I thought I already had it figured out.
Rubric: How can your peer use their identified writing improvements in future academic and non-academic situations? You may also discuss how you might use what your peer has pointed out in your future writing.
Peer Writing: What i have learned about my writing was that it was all over the place. i used to have so many ideas and so many words to write/type but it was everywhere and it didn't make sense . in the first half of this class i felt overwhelmed which ultimately caused me to scramble with my essays . after about a couple weeks in of the class i started to understand the process and what method i needed to use to be sure i answered questions and explained topics to the fullest. i started to create a plan and use my time management skills so that i won't have to crunch everything in at the last minute. i also learned to create a flow in my essays that made sense to the readers and they fully can understand my writing .

",gpt-4-0613,"Comment:

It's commendable to see your self-awareness about your own writing process, and how you've managed to identify and rectify the issues you had initially. Your experience resonates with me, as I too have struggled with assignments. I think your approach to planning and time management is something we can all learn from. I find it particularly impressive how you've learned to give your essays a logical flow, thereby enhancing readability.

In future academic situations, these skills will be invaluable. Not only in essay writing, but in any circumstance where clear, well-structured communication is required. Non-academically, your improved writing skills could be useful in scenarios like writing emails, drafting reports, or even in personal situations where you need to express your thoughts or ideas clearly.

Your journey has inspired me to pay more attention to creating a flow in my writing and to manage my time more effectively. I believe others can also benefit from your experience. Keep up the great work!"

“Upon finishing the first flight of stairs, Harry saw a creature holding a bucket. Images of Dobby sprang to his mind immediately, but the differences were clear between the elf before him and his friend at Hogwarts. The way this elf walked was more hunched, as well as the numerous white hairs on its body. Its grunt was deep and faulty, and when its eyes met Harry's, they were empty.

""Kreacher can't stand these people in my mistress's house any longer. Ah... what would she do to Kreacher if she knew that he let these people into her noble house?"" The elf grumbled, muttering as he averted his eyes from Harry and dragged himself toward the flight of stairs Harry had just ascended. ""Mudbloods inside my mistress's house. How much more disgrace must this poor elf endure?""

As he watched the elf go down, Harry knew he didn't feel much sympathy for him and had the feeling that the sentiment was mutual. The boy felt ashamed to think of comparing him to Dobby.”",gpt-4-0613,"Upon cresting the topmost step of the initial flight of stairs, Harry was met with the sight of a creature, a bucket clutched in its bony hand. Instantly, his mind was filled with memories of Dobby, his loyal friend at Hogwarts. However, despite the superficial similarities, the disparities between the elf standing in front of him and Dobby were unmistakable.

The gait of this new elf was more stooped, its posture suggestive of a life burdened by more hardships. Its body was speckled with countless white hairs, each one standing out in stark contrast against its wrinkled skin. Its grunts were deeper, tinged with a roughness that suggested years of discontent. When the elf's gaze met Harry's, there was an unmistakable void in its eyes, devoid of any warmth or friendliness.

""Kreacher can no longer bear the presence of these interlopers in my mistress's esteemed residence. Oh... what dire consequences would befall Kreacher if she knew that it was he who permitted their entry into her dignified domicile?"" The elf's voice was a low grumble, filled with resentment. His eyes, filled with distaste, avoided Harry's as he lumbered toward the staircase that Harry had just climbed. ""Mudbloods infesting my mistress's precious home. How much more humiliation must Kreacher, this pitiful elf, withstand?""

As Harry observed the elf's shuffling descent, he was well aware that he felt little in the way of sympathy for this creature, and he had a strong suspicion that the feeling was mutual. Harry couldn't help but experience a pang of embarrassment at the thought that he had initially compared this elf to his dear friend Dobby."

"PROMPT: Revise the following narrative scene to enhance its descriptive elements, improve pacing, and create a more engaging atmosphere, then continue the scene:

 It's a little over 1 am back at Johanna's house and I couldn't sleep, still processing the ritual the four of us will have to partake, including Kaisa. Johanna's right next to me sleeping soundly. I smiled as I looked down at her, being so beautiful in that position.

Now at this point I'd probably have my fun with her while she's sleeping (and she really wouldn't mind it at all). But I decided to set my perverted mind aside for now. I softly land a kiss on Johanna's cheek and left the bedroom for the kitchen. As I made my way, I saw Hilda sitting by the window looking on the outside, holding her knees up.

“Can't sleep either, huh?” I said to her.

“Oh!” Hilda startled. “Sorry, I didn't realize you were there. But yeah, I can't sleep.”

I chuckled as I took out a bottle of milk from the fridge and poured it in a glass. Then carried it with me as I went towards Hilda. “Nervous about getting married?” I asked. ",gpt-4-0613,"The clock blinked 1:17 am in the silent heart of Johanna's home, each gentle tick echoing in the thick silence of the night. I lay wide awake, the impending ritual that we four, including Kaisa, were entangled in, whirling relentlessly in my mind. Beside me, Johanna's rhythmic breathing was a soft lullaby that sleep refused to heed.

The moonlight tiptoed through the cracks in the curtains, casting an ethereal glow on her peaceful visage. A soft smile curled at my lips as I admired her, the way the silvery light danced on her delicate features, making her appear even more enchanting.

In other circumstances, succumbing to the playful desires of my mind would have been an enticing prospect, one Johanna wouldn't mind either. But tonight, I decided to quell my impulses, choosing instead to plant a feather-light kiss on her rosy cheek before slipping out from under the covers.

The house was hushed, as if holding its breath, the only noise being the occasional creak of the wooden floorboards under my bare feet as I padded towards the kitchen. As I traversed the dimly lit hallway, I spotted Hilda, a silhouette against the window, her knees drawn up to her chest, gaze lost in the stillness of the night.

""Insomnia's a shared trait tonight, huh?"" I ventured, my voice breaking the silence like a stone thrown into a serene pond.

Hilda jolted, a deer caught in headlights. ""Oh! I didn't hear you,"" she stammered, a faint blush creeping up her cheeks. ""I just...can't seem to find sleep.""

A chuckle rumbled in my chest as I retrieved a bottle of milk from the fridge, the cool glass a stark contrast against my warm hands. I poured the creamy liquid into a glass, the soft glug-glug echoing like a quiet melody. Cradling the glass in my hands, I joined Hilda by the window.

""Getting cold feet about the big leap?"" I asked, the question hanging in the air, awaiting her response."

Write long, original, interesting and imaginative scene. In it, Priscilla and Irene are both in their beds. Priscilla, who is slightly shy and rather private and introverted, yet also inquisitive and curious, is simultaneously preoccupied with reading, writing her mysterious notes and applying her makeup.

The room hums with anachronistic oddities: a Bakelite standing lamp, an Art Deco vanity mirror, an Edison cylinder phonograph, its serpentine horn casting shadows on the carved stone walls.

Two immaculately dressed patients, PRISCILLA DRUIN and IRENE WIDRICH, lie in twin brass beds capped with a dark mahogany canopy. The sterile scent of disinfectant fights a losing battle against the underlying aroma of old books and aging wood.

Priscilla, a vision of reserved introversion with eyes hidden behind too-large rhinestone spectacles, brows furrowed in concentration. She commutes between her notepad, a well-thumbed Gothic novel and a small crushed velvet case bursting with antique makeup.

Suddenly, Priscilla pauses, her attention on her vanity mirror. She studies her face for a moment, adjusting her cat-eye glasses, applies a streak of audacious cherry-red lipstick, only to disappear again behind her spectacles, engrossed in her notes.

Across the room, doubts and distress cage Irene, her sparkling eyes filled with curiosity and frustration. Restless, her fingers drum on the blanket, her foot taps an irregular rhythm on the starched bedsheets. She tries to attract Priscilla's attention with a COUGH, but gets absorbed in her predicament again.

IRENE
(chuckles sarcastically)
Such a quaint place they've found for us, eh Priscilla? Victorian Era styled bedrooms, folks with beliefs that women's places are at homes, dictator-types running this...clinic.

She rolls her eyes theatrically, attempting to draw Priscilla in with wild hand gestures. Priscilla offers a non-committal smile but goes back to her activities. Irene huffs, piqued by Priscilla's absorption in her tasks.

IRENE
(can’t resist)
What ARE you writing there, Priscilla? Love letters to Boris Karloff?

But Priscilla doesn't bite; instead provides a graceful squeak of laughter, acknowledging Irene's quip but refusing to gratify her curiosity.

IRENE
(grumbly)
It's insufferable, you know? Being bedridden in the prime of our...

Priscilla cuts her off with a glance, her eyes almost imploring Irene to stop. Irene withers slightly, her demeanor turning petulant.

But then Priscilla, without saying a word, picks up a beautifully crafted vintage box, overwritten with ""Pandora."" She opens it to reveal two tastefully decorated cupcakes. With a smile, she extends one to Irene.

The air in the room eases a bit, and as the camera pulls back, we see them, Irene animatedly chattering away, Priscilla silently indulging her while nibbling on her treat. Their bizarre world makes a strange sense now, the anachronistic eccentricities become part of their shared reality.

"I'd like help with my toy model of cosmology.
The base premise is that the geometry of spacetime causes incorrect measurements.
A simple example being acceleration due to gravity.
This model posits the following:
  1. the geometry of spacetime (and our perspective within it) is responsible for the appearance of an accelerating expanding spacetime. In fact, this illusion is purely geometric. That is, the expansion, and its accelerating nature, is purely a fiction of geometry.
  2. the geometry of spacetime makes lightspeed appear to be finite. That is, the infinite amount of energy required to reach c is evidence that lightspeed is (or can be modelled by) a transfinite ordinal. Lightspeed is demonstrably faster than any finite speed we can observe from within our spacetime. We measure it as finite because of a geometric illusion.
  3. dE/dv = sqrt(1-(v/c')^2)/((v/c')-1) where c' is the finite speed we measure to be invariant everywhere (another piece of evidence)
Help me develop the field equations for this model.
We should start with deriving the metric.
",gpt-4-0613,"Developing a new model of cosmology is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of theoretical physics and mathematics. It seems like you are proposing a model where the apparent structure of the Universe is entirely due to geometric distortions of spacetime, rather than physical phenomena. This is a fascinating concept, but it would require a significant shift in our understanding of physics.

The starting point of any such theory would be the metric, which describes the geometric structure of spacetime. In general relativity, the metric is a mathematical function that provides the distances between points in spacetime.

Let's denote the metric tensor by g_μν. The metric tensor is a function of the spacetime coordinates x^μ, and it is symmetric, meaning g_μν = g_νμ.

The metric tensor allows us to calculate the distance ds between two infinitesimally close points in spacetime:

ds^2 = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν.

The field equations of your model would be equations that determine the metric tensor g_μν. In general relativity, these are the Einstein field equations.

However, your model seems to involve some novel concepts, such as a finite speed of light that is actually a geometric illusion, and a different physical interpretation of the energy required to reach the speed of light. These would require new mathematical formalism, which would extend or modify the Einstein field equations.

Developing this formalism is a large task that goes beyond what can be provided here. You may need to conduct research into differential geometry, general relativity, and cosmology, and potentially collaborate with researchers in these fields.

Just to note, your proposed model would need to be able to reproduce the successful predictions of the standard cosmological model and general relativity, or provide even more accurate predictions, in order to gain acceptance in the scientific community. This is a high bar, given the many successes of these theories."

Luciana glances at Gloria, who gives her a playful wink. Even in this situation, Gloria's spirit is unbroken.

DR. BENDS (CONT'D)

And it will not rise again.
So let us cry out: Long live the world!
Forward, humanity,
Ride the wagon that carries you
Into the depths of the dark tomb!

The king has died, he has been buried,
And he will not rise again.
So let us also cry out: Long live the king!
Leader and Lord of our souls,
Guide us into the high pits of eternity!
Our life is in the heavenly depths!

Let us leave the dead bodies on the road
Of our fathers and grandfathers,
For with them it is a longer journey
Towards the destruction of humanity!
Life has been drawn from them,
And now it is time for our death!

Broken chains are already covered in rust,
And they will never be cleaned.
So let us cry out! Long live the bonds of freedom!
Today the world is new,
Today there are new orders,
So there is no time to live, the time to die has come.

• Ensures a positive and productive team environment
• Consistently meets with team members on a 1:1 basis

please answer the questions:
Create Belonging
Give me an example of how you ensure your direct reports and/or colleagues feel a sense of inclusion and belonging?
• What factors did you consider?
• What was your approach?
• What feedback have you received?
• How did you measure the value?
",gpt-4-0613,"Example of Ensuring Inclusion and Belonging:

As a Project Engineer/Manager at the University Lab, I led a team of varied professionals, including researchers, technicians, and administrative staff. Recognizing the importance of diversity for innovation and team synergy, I made inclusivity and belonging the cornerstone of our team culture.

1. Factors Considered:
I considered the potential for diversity of thought, experience, and background to contribute positively to the team and our projects. I also recognized the potential for feelings of isolation or exclusion among staff who might feel 'different', hence the need for a conscious, proactive approach to inclusion.

2. Approach:
One of my key strategies was to hold regular team meetings where everyone had the opportunity to present their ideas and updates on their work. Additionally, I encouraged one-on-one meetings to offer individualized support and guidance. Through these meetings, I fostered an environment where everyone felt heard and valued.

I also implemented a 'buddy system' for new team members: pairing them with a more experienced team member to help them understand our work culture, processes, and methodologies, thus ensuring they felt included from the start.

3. Feedback Received:
I received positive feedback from both the team members and upper management. Team members expressed that they felt more comfortable sharing their ideas, leading to higher productivity and improved team dynamics. Management noticed the increased productivity and the positive shift in team morale.

4. Measuring the Value:
The value of this approach was measured in several ways. First, we saw an increase in team productivity, with projects being delivered on time and within budget. Second, we experienced a decrease in staff turnover, indicating higher job satisfaction. Third, we measured employee engagement and satisfaction through anonymous surveys, which showed an improvement in scores around belonging and inclusion.

Regarding compliance with international standards, UK regulations, and legal requirements, I ensured that our lab practices were in line with ISO standards for laboratory safety and quality management. I also made sure we complied with the UK Equality Act to promote equality and prevent discrimination within our team."
"The Date today is (08.02.2024).
A Girl let call her Emese is a european girl living in a big city.
Born at date (12.11.2004).
No myopia in her family.
Her first prescrition was (OD:SPH-0.0D CYL-0.5Dx180) (OS:SPH-0.25D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date(14.10.2021) at almost 17 years of age when myopia onset.
Her second prescription was (OD:SPH-0.250D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-0.5.0D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date (12.04.2022) at 17.5 years of age.
Her third prescription is OVERCORRECTED by SPH -0.5D both eyes, and the prescription was (OD:SPH-0.5D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-0.75D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date (17.10.2022).
Her last prescription is OVERCORRECTED by SPH -0.75D both eyes, and the prescription was (OD:SPH-0.75D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-1.25D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date (17.06.2023) at 18.5 years of age. She is in school for the next 2.5 years, using computer 4+ hours per day. What could be her progression in the next few years? With example prescriptions please, and likelyhood, in percent.",gpt-4-0613,"Myopia, or nearsightedness, tends to progress during the teenage years, with the rate of progression varying from person to person. It's usually more aggressive in the early onset, often slowing down in the late teens or early twenties. Factors like near work, such as computer usage or reading, can contribute to the progression.

Given Emese's trend of increasing myopia, her frequent computer usage, and her ongoing education, there's a possibility her myopia could continue to progress for the next few years, although likely at a slower pace as she's already in her late teens.

Here's a potential progression scenario for Emese, though it's important to note this is an educated guess and individual progression can vary:

1. By the end of 2024: (OD:SPH-1.25D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-1.75D CYL-0.25Dx160)
2. By the end of 2025: (OD:SPH-1.5D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-2.0D CYL-0.25Dx160)
3. By the end of 2026: (OD:SPH-1.75D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-2.25D CYL-0.25Dx160)

As for percentages, if we consider that myopia progression could be around -0.25 to -0.50 diopters per year in her current age group and lifestyle, there's a 60-70% likelihood the above scenario could take place. However, these are estimates and individual experiences can differ, so regular eye exams are key to monitor her myopia and adjust her prescription as needed.

It's also worth mentioning that there are ways to manage myopia progression, such as Ortho-K lenses, low-dose atropine eye drops, or multifocal contact lenses. Emese should consult with her optometrist or ophthalmologist to discuss these options."
"Have been pondering discussions around art this morning and put up thoughts on Twitter. Looking for AI feedback. Please consider: Can be curious if wonder about a poem or song, but what does it MEAN?

And maturity is in understanding the question.

If ask your soul can ponder with epiphany.

If ask person who created? You missed the point. Can be told anything then and race away happy with nonsense.

Is funny to me but exasperating, when come across some person on the web claiming the point of a song from what the songwriter claimed.

Those are lies either deliberately or naively.

Songwriter has no clue or song would not have been successful enough for anyone to care.

Can just TELL you all kinds of things, if can be explained. Understand?

BUT, if communicate FEELING through poetic means then is about resonance with something INSIDE you.

That varies from person to person. Is not simply something can just explain to you. Must find in yourself.",gpt-4-0613,"I couldn't agree more with your sentiments. Art, in all its forms, is indeed a deeply personal experience. It's not just about understanding the literal meaning of a poem or a song; it's about how it resonates within you, the feelings it evokes, and the thoughts it provokes.

While the creator of the art piece may have their own interpretation or inspiration, it doesn't necessarily align with what others perceive or feel. The beauty of art lies in its subjectivity. It allows for a multitude of interpretations, each valid and unique to the individual experiencing it.

Sometimes, the creator themselves may not fully understand the depth or the impact of their own creation, hence the notion that 'The songwriter has no clue or the song would not have been successful enough for anyone to care'. The art becomes something beyond the artist, taking on a life of its own.

In essence, art is not something to be simply explained. It's something to be felt, to be experienced. It's a journey of self-discovery, as much as it is an appreciation of the artist's work.

I hope this resonates with your thoughts."

""Such a Ga enrichment in the region next to the contact could appear as beneficial for reducing the contact resistivity in the junction. Yet, the decaying Ga concentration profile was demonstrated to be just an artifact caused by the knock-on of Ga atoms present on the surface. In fact, by comparing the composition profiles of Si\textsubscript{1-x}Ge\textsubscript{x}:B:Ga layers acquired before and after HCl wet-cleaning, a severe variation in the $\rm [Ga]_{chem}$ profiles emerges: the surface peak is no longer present and the bulk Ga concentration is significantly reduced compared to prior the cleaning (Fig. \ref{fig:SiGeBGa_clean}) \cite{rengo_b_2022}. This indicates that a large fraction of Ga atoms is present on top of the film surface, likely in the form of oxides, and only the dopants embedded in the crystalline matrix are retained during the selective etching.  """,gpt-4-0613,"The enrichment of gallium (Ga) in the region adjacent to the contact can be seen as advantageous for decreasing the contact resistivity in the junction. However, the diminishing Ga concentration profile was proven to be merely an artifact triggered by the displacement of Ga atoms existing on the surface. Indeed, when comparing the composition profiles of Si1-xGex:B:Ga layers taken before and after HCl wet-cleaning, a significant change in the chemical gallium concentration profiles becomes evident: the surface peak no longer exists and the overall Ga concentration is markedly lower than before the cleaning process. This suggests that a substantial proportion of Ga atoms are located on the film's surface, likely as oxides, and only the dopants within the crystalline matrix remain during the selective etching process."

"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This film features Celestine Weeks, a beautiful, elegant, sexy young woman who is a wheelchair-bound paraplegic. Due to her spinal injury, Celestine is incontinent and has to wear adult diapers. Write long, original, creative, interesting and titillating scene featuring the following. Celestine wheels back at her apartment after a stroll outside. She can't shake the feeling that she has either a secret admirer or a stalker. While she looks through the windows, various things come into her head. Celestine begins removing her clothes, leaving only her adult diaper on. She checks that it is not wet and puts her hand inside it. While Celestine has lost most of the feeling below her waist, some sensation in certain regions remains, in fact it has become even stronger. As Celestine finds the pleasureous spot, she moans in extasy.",gpt-4-0613,"INT. CELESTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The room is bathed in soft light, illuminating the world of CELESTINE WEEKS. Celestine, a beautiful, elegant, and sensuous woman, rolls in from the outside, her wheelchair gliding over the polished hardwood floor. She's clad in a flowing sundress that brushes against the wheels of her chair, hinting at her free-spirited nature.

The apartment is a mix of antique furniture and modern amenities. Celestine's wheelchair is a testament to the fact - a stylish but functional testament to her indomitable spirit.

Her brows knit together as she gazes out the large French windows, a sense of unease gripping her. She senses it, an unseen presence. Is it a secret admirer or a relentless stalker? Her mind is a whirlpool of thoughts, the uncertainty adding an edge to her solace.

With a sigh, she turns away from the window. Determined to push away her worries, she starts to undress, her movements graceful and deliberate. Celestine's clothes fall away like petals from a flower, revealing her adult diaper. A necessity due to her spinal injury, but it hasn't dampened her spirit or sexuality.

Her hands, familiar with the routine, checks the diaper. She lets out a small sigh of relief upon finding it dry. Then, with a trembling hand, she slips it inside.

Celestine's face is a mask of concentration. Most of the feeling below her waist is lost to her, yet some regions pulsate with heightened sensation. Her hand locates the pleasureous spot and a wave of ecstasy washes over her. A moan escapes her lips, a sensuous sound that fills the room, echoing her pleasure.

Her body convulses in response, a sweet shudder running through it. For a moment, everything else fades away - the stalker, her disability, her worries. All that exists is the intense pleasure coursing through her body.

As the ecstasy recedes, she withdraws her hand, her breath hitching in her throat. With shaking hands, she smooths out her diaper, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. Celestine rests back into her wheelchair, her cheeks flushed with pleasure and her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.

CUT TO:

EXT. CELESTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The night is eerily calm outside, the shadowy figure of a man stands watch in the distance, the silhouette of his face barely visible in the moonlight. His eyes, however, remain fixed on the lit window of Celestine's apartment.

FADE OUT."

"European girl named Emese born at 12.11.2004 had her first glasses prescription at 04.10.2021 with OD SPH 0.0D CYL -0.5Dx180 OS SPH -0.25D CYL -0.25Dx160. Her second precription at 04.04.2022 was OD SPH 0.0D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -0.5D CYL -0.25Dx160. Her next prescription at 11.10.2022 no progression but overcorrected by SPH -0.5D both eyes. Her last prescription at 06.06.2023 no progression but overcorrected by  additional SPH -0.75D both eyes.  She will be in school for the next 2.5 years, and using computer and smartphone 10+ hours. She going out just for school. What is her predicted myopia progression by the next years at 20, 25, 30 with diopters. In details with examples in diopters.  What is the impact of overcorrection? What if overcorrection maintened the same? No problem or sympoms by overcorrection. With example prescriptions in diopter",gpt-4-0613,"Predicting the progression of myopia is tricky since it depends on various factors such as genetics, visual habits, and environment. However, considering Emese's lifestyle and current prescription, it's likely her myopia may progress further.

1. Age 20: Considering a rate of about -0.50D per year (average for a high screen user), by the age of 20, Emese might have a prescription around OD SPH -3.50D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -3.75D CYL -0.25Dx160.

2. Age 25: Assuming the same rate of progression, by the age of 25, her prescription could be OD SPH -6.00D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -6.25D CYL -0.25Dx160.

3. Age 30: By the age of 30, her prescription might be OD SPH -8.50D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -8.75D CYL -0.25Dx160.

Overcorrection can sometimes be used as a strategy to slow down myopia progression, but it's not without risks. It can lead to eye strain and may increase the risk of developing retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts in the future.

If overcorrection is maintained the same, it might slow down the progression to some extent but it's unlikely to stop it completely. For example, if Emese's glasses continue to be overcorrected by -0.75D, her prescription at age 20 might be OD SPH -3.00D CYL -0.75Dx180 OS SPH -3.25D CYL -0.25Dx160, which is slightly less severe than without the overcorrection.

It's important for Emese to have regular eye exams to monitor her eyesight and adjust her prescription as needed. She should also consider lifestyle changes, such as reducing screen time and spending more time outdoors, as these can help slow down the progression of myopia.

Please note that these are just estimates. The actual progression of her myopia could be faster or slower, and it's important for Emese to regularly consult with an eye care professional."

"I'm running a West Marches roleplaying campaign. A West Marches campaign is a type of sandbox-style campaign where players have a lot of freedom to explore and choose their own adventures in a large, open world. I need a location to add to the map for my players to explore. Create a location for the players to explore, using the 5 room dungeon method: an entrance and guardian; a puzzle or roleplaying challenge; a red herring; a climax, big battle or conflict; and a plot twist. For each room, list the encounter stats and treasure. If there are any riddles or puzzles, include a complete, detailed description of the riddle or puzzle, so the dungeon master has enough information to present them to the player. Do your best and try to be creative and come up with ideas that can be used as plot hooks for other places on the campaign map.
",gpt-4-0613,"Location: Ruins of the Sky Citadel

1. Entrance and Guardian: The entrance to the Sky Citadel is guarded by a mechanical golem, a relic from the times when the Citadel was a thriving fortress. The golem is powered by an ancient magical gem, and will attack any intruder who does not possess the Crest of the Sky Citadel, a rare artifact lost in time.

   Encounter Stats: Mechanical Golem (AC: 17, HP: 75, Damage: 1d10 + 5, slam attack)

   Treasure: If players manage to defeat the golem, they can obtain the magical gem powering it. It can be used to forge powerful magical weapons or armor.

2. Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge: Once inside, players encounter the Hall of Winds, a large room with four massive stone statues each representing a cardinal wind direction. To proceed further, they need to solve a riddle inscribed on a plaque: ""The West Wind weeps, the North Wind howls, the East Wind sighs and the South Wind laughs."" Players must turn the statues so that the West statue faces the golem (symbolizing its defeat), the North statue faces the entrance (symbolizing the difficult path they've taken), the East statue faces the inner Citadel (symbolizing their journey ahead), and the South statue faces the players (symbolizing their joy of adventure).

3. Red Herring: As players proceed, they will come across the Chamber of Echoes. The echoes inside the chamber amplify sounds to a dangerous degree, causing illusions of monstrous creatures. This is intended to intimidate and misdirect players, but there are no real threats.

4. Climax, Big Battle or Conflict: The climax takes place at the Heart of the Sky Citadel, where a rogue air elemental, driven mad by centuries of isolation, attacks the players.

   Encounter Stats: Rogue Air Elemental (AC: 15, HP: 90, Damage: 2d8 + 2, whirlwind attack)

   Treasure: If players manage to calm or defeat the elemental, they can obtain the Crown of the Sky Citadel. The crown grants the wearer control over wind and air elementals.

5. Plot Twist: After the battle, players discover that the Sky Citadel was not abandoned but rather was protecting a dormant celestial being, a Star Nymph. The Nymph thanks the players and offers a boon of celestial aid in their future quests. However, her awakening has alerted other celestial and fiendish beings to her presence, setting up potential future conflicts.

This location serves as a link to other locations on the map, as the Crest of the Sky Citadel, the magical gem, and the Crown of the Sky Citadel could all be parts of other quests or keys to other dungeons. The celestial being can provide plot hooks for other adventures, and the awakened celestial being can lead to encounters with other celestial or fiendish beings."
"1. 19 year old Emese who is thin (165cm 48kg.), have pain under, and below her kneecap, when straighten her leg fully, or climbing a bit more stairs, easily overuse it.

6. What type of brace would be the best until the exam, considering, that she is in school, and other daily activities?
7. Can you name some braces what could be the best?
8. What brace you suggest more than others? with link please.
8. Point by point please.",gpt-4-0613,"1. It sounds like Emese may be experiencing patellofemoral pain syndrome, which is common in young adults, especially those who are active. Her thin physique could potentially contribute to less natural cushioning around her joints, leading to discomfort.

2. While waiting for an ultrasonic exam, it's important to keep the knee stable and mitigate any possible damage.

3. If the Patellar Tendon Strap didn't provide the desired support, it's good that she is exploring other options.

4. An elastic Compression Sleeve could indeed provide the support Emese needs. It could help to reduce pain and swelling, while also providing support to the knee joint during daily activities.

5. Given the unlimited budget and the need for the best possible option, a hinged knee brace could be considered. This type of brace offers the highest level of support, and is often used by athletes dealing with knee injuries. They help to control the knee's range of motion, while also providing support to the ligaments and tendons.

6. Some recommended braces include:

   - DonJoy Performance Bionic Knee Brace - This brace is designed to treat and protect ligament instabilities and provide support during activity. Its top and bottom stretch webbing closure ensures perfect fit and easy application. [Link](https://www.donjoyperformance.com/product/bionic-knee-brace)

   - McDavid 429X Hinged Knee Brace - This brace offers maximum support due to its geared polycentric hinges and additional compression and heat therapy. [Link](https://www.mcdavidusa.com/products/429x-knee-brace-with-dual-disc-hinges)

   - Shock Doctor Ultra Knee Supporter - This brace provides bilateral support hinges and tempered aluminum stays for knee stability, protection and increased performance. [Link](https://www.shockdoctor.com/products/ultra-knee-support-with-bilateral-hinges)

7. Out of these options, the DonJoy Performance Bionic Knee Brace is highly recommended. It's designed specifically for athletes with ligament instabilities and offers a high level of support and protection. However, it is crucial that Emese consults her doctor before deciding on a particular brace to ensure it's the right fit for her needs."

"When we consider the question categories, various taxonomies were proposed. An important contribution towards this direction is Lehnert’s classification [18]. As part of development of a computational model for question-answering, Lehnert classified questions based on the idea of conceptual categorization. As per this idea, in order for the question to be interpreted correctly, it must be placed in the right conceptual category, otherwise it will lead to wrong reasoning. In this sense, the emphasis should be on the context in which the question was asked. Accordingly, Lehnert proposed thirteen such conceptual categories, namely causal antecedent, goal orientation, enablement, causal consequent, verification, disjunctive, instrumental, concept completion, expectational, judgmental, quantification, feature specification and request",gpt-4-0613,"You're correct. Wendy Lehnert's classification system for questions has been highly influential in the field of AI and natural language processing. Here is a brief rundown of what each category means:

1. Causal Antecedent: Questions that ask about the cause of an event or situation.
2. Goal Orientation: Questions that ask about the purpose or goal of an action or decision.
3. Enablement: Questions that ask about the necessary conditions to make an event happen.
4. Causal Consequent: Questions asking about the results or effects of an event or situation.
5. Verification: Questions that seek to confirm the truth or false of a statement.
6. Disjunctive: Questions that present alternatives and ask the user to choose one.
7. Instrumental: Questions about the tools or methods used to accomplish something.
8. Concept Completion: Questions that require filling in a missing piece of information or details.
9. Expectational: Questions about what is likely to happen in a given scenario.
10. Judgmental: Questions that ask for an opinion or evaluation.
11. Quantification: Questions that ask about the amount, number, or degree of something.
12. Feature Specification: Questions that ask for specific attributes or characteristics of something.
13. Request: Questions that ask the addressee to perform an action.

"Write a news report, of the shocking debacle during the recent Dominion raid into Sector 001, in which the cadets in training at the Starfleet Academy were called up to man undercrewed starships together with their instructors. Both suffered severe losses in the battle that also resulted in thousands of civilian deaths in several major cities along the Western Seaboard by Dominion terror-bombing, which also destroyed the iconic Golden Gate Bridge that has stood for several centuries. Amid all the chaos that followed the raid, a candlelight vigil is being held at the Academy and many other places around the whole solar system, while some in the Federation Council is questioning, often quite loudly, the wisdom of throwing cadets and Academy cadres into action.",gpt-4-0613,"**Starfleet Academy Cadets and Instructors Suffer Severe Losses in Shocking Dominion Raid on Sector 001**

In an unprecedented act of aggression, the Dominion launched a brutal raid into Sector 001, resulting in catastrophic losses for both Starfleet Academy cadets and their instructors who were called upon to man undercrewed starships in the heat of the battle. The shocking debacle has also led to massive civilian casualties, with deaths estimated in the thousands.

The raid, which saw the Dominion employ terror-bombing tactics, wrought havoc on several major cities along the Western Seaboard. Iconic landmarks such as the centuries-old Golden Gate Bridge were not spared from the destruction, adding to the despair and shock of the beleaguered population.

In the aftermath of the raid, the survivors, both civilian and military, are attempting to make sense of the carnage. Candlelight vigils are being held at Starfleet Academy and across the solar system, as citizens mourn the loss of life and infrastructure. The flickering lights serve as a poignant reminder of the resilience of the human spirit amidst the darkest of times.

Meanwhile, the Federation Council is embroiled in heated debates. Several members are questioning the wisdom of the decision to involve Academy cadets and their instructors in such a high-stakes battle. The loss of life among the young cadets and the experienced instructors has raised serious doubts about the strategic planning and decision-making within Starfleet.

Critics argue that the cadets, despite their training, were not adequately prepared for the harsh realities of war, especially one involving an adversary as formidable as the Dominion. Similarly, the loss of highly skilled instructors, who play a crucial role in shaping the future of Starfleet, is seen as a blow to the organization's long-term operational capacity.

While the debate rages on, the focus remains on providing support to the grieving and the traumatized, and beginning the long and arduous task of rebuilding both the physical infrastructure and the morale of the survivors. As Starfleet and the Federation mourn their losses, the resolve to stand firm against such acts of aggression remains stronger than ever."

SMALL APARTMENT - DAY

Marcel Messier, sporting an unkempt beard and disheveled hair, is hunched over a small dining table, scribbling notes in a tattered notebook. The room is littered with coffee cups, pizza boxes, and stacks of books. A record player hums a quiet lullaby.

The camera pans to CAROLINE HERTIG, a breathtaking young woman, lying in a hospital bed set up in their living room. Her face is pale but maintains its beauty, her eyes are bright but filled with a mixture of sorrow and resilience.

Marcel glances at her from time to time, offering her a warm smile. He then pushes his chair back, stands up, and ambles over to her. His voice, though naturally sarcastic, now takes a gentler tone.

MARCEL
(whispering)
Alright, Miss Diva, time to turn.

He gently rolls her to the side, adjusting her pillows before rolling her back. His eyes never leave her face, always checking for discomfort.

Caroline smiles faintly, her eyes expressing gratitude. Marcel leans in, tenderly kissing her forehead. He then moves to the small kitchenette, where he begins to prepare a meal.

Suddenly, the door creaks open, and OTTO LOOSLI steps in. He's a tall, lanky figure, with a calm demeanor and an absent-minded gaze. He's holding a brown paper bag and a set of blueprints under his arm.

OTTO
(cheerfully)
Hey, lovebirds.

Marcel chuckles, shaking his head as he continues to stir the pot on the stove.

MARCEL
(sarcastically)
Otto, you charmer, you're just in time for dinner.

Otto moves to Caroline's side, placing the bag on the bedside table. He pulls out a small mechanical device.

OTTO
(excitedly)
Look what I brought, Caroline. It's a voice synthesizer. I thought we could try it out.

Caroline's eyes light up. Otto starts fiddling with the device, absent-mindedly explaining how it works. Marcel plates up the dinner and brings it over, feeding Caroline with careful, loving spoonfuls.

Caroline uses her eyes to communicate, and Otto and Marcel, understanding their friend so well, interpret her glances and expressions. The room fills with laughter as Otto shares his latest engineering mishaps. The atmosphere is light, comfortable.

Marcel continues to care for Caroline, washing her, changing her, always with a joke or a sarcastic comment to lighten the mood. He's a natural caregiver, despite his usual reckless and irresponsible behavior.

Otto, engrossed in his blueprints, occasionally glances up to join in the conversation. He's absent-minded but present when it matters.

As the day turns into night, Marcel tucks Caroline in, whispering a sweet goodnight into her ear. Otto, now engrossed in assembling the voice synthesizer, works until the wee hours.

The scene ends with Marcel sitting by Caroline's bed, holding her hand, his eyes filled with love and determination. Despite the unusual circumstances, their friendship and love for each other remain strong and unbroken.

"There's a country governed by a system named Moloch. The system serves no one. Moloch is not a tyranny run for the benefit of a small minority, nor the majority oppressing a underclass. Moloch grinds everyone equally, and yet, those who speak against Moloch are executed, and those who hesitate to name those who would resist or cooperate with their punishment, go with them, and in this way, so long as everyone does not abandon Moloch at once, which would require coordination on a level beyond the human capacity, Moloch's rule cannot be challenged.

Write a story about how this country came to be, and particularly, how the system self identified with the name of incarnate misery due to coordination failure during its rise to power.",gpt-4-0613,"Once upon a time, there was a small nation named Eloria, nestled between mighty mountains and a vast sea. Eloria was a fertile land, rich in natural resources and inhabited by an industrious and intelligent populace. For centuries, Eloria had been a beacon of prosperity and peace, ruled by a council of elders who strived for the common good and upheld the principles of justice and equality.

Eloria was indeed a paradise, but like every Eden, it had its serpent. The serpent in Eloria's paradise was called Ambition. The people of Eloria started seeking power and wealth, and their harmonious society began to crumble. The council of elders, once a symbol of unity and wisdom, turned into a battleground for personal interests. The principles of justice and equality were replaced by corruption and nepotism. The nation was on the brink of collapse, its people desperate for a solution.

Out of this chaos emerged a group of scholars and philosophers who proposed a new system of governance. They called it Moloch, named after the ancient deity associated with child sacrifice, as a testament to their willingness to sacrifice personal interests for the greater good. Moloch was supposed to be a self-regulating system of governance that would serve everyone equally, irrespective of their social status or wealth.

However, the architects of Moloch had overlooked one crucial aspect - the human propensity for self-preservation. They had underestimated the power of fear and the instinct to survive at any cost. Even as Moloch started grinding everyone equally, the people began to see it as a monstrous entity, feeding on their fears and insecurities. The scholars and philosophers who had created Moloch became its first victims, executed for speaking against the system they had birthed.

Those who hesitated to name those who would resist Moloch, or cooperate with their punishment, were also executed, setting a precedent of fear and submission. The name Moloch, initially chosen to symbolize sacrifice and selflessness, became associated with tyranny and oppression.

The rise of Moloch was marked by a significant coordination failure. While the architects of Moloch had envisioned a system that would serve everyone, they had failed to coordinate their efforts effectively. The principles of the system were misinterpreted, and the execution of those principles flawed, resulting in a monstrous entity that served no one.

And so, Eloria became a land governed by a system that was a testament to incarnate misery and coordination failure. The people lived in fear of Moloch, a system that had been created to serve them but had instead"

"Write me a Loner Warrior's diary log about finding a Bedgrim {Species's name for Bed monster} under her bed eating her nightmares. {Note: It is Jade's last night in the inn before she decides to continue with her adventure, but then she wakes up to a unknown stirring that sends a chill down her spine.
""The Innkeeper told me no one else was in here... And that sounds too big to be a rat."" She grabbed her greatsword from the side of the bed and braces herself for what she may find. [The Bedgrim's name is Noa, the name lurked in Jade's mind despite not getting introduced properly due to the beastly fae being silent.] {Only Noa's hulking cloaked body, glowing lavender eyes and teeth were perceived} ∆",gpt-4-0613,"Diary Log: Entry Number Unknown

As a lone warrior, I've danced with death and dined with danger. Yet, tonight, on what was supposed to be my last peaceful slumber at the inn, I encountered something unexpected. Something lurking beneath my bed; a steady stirring, an almost indiscernible shuffling that sent a chill crawling down my spine like an unwelcome guest.

""The Innkeeper gave his word that no soul crossed these steps but mine....,"" I mused, pulling my trusty greatsword in a deeply ingrained reflex. Its comforting weight anchoring my heightened senses. But the sound... it echoed larger than any rat I've ever encountered. Larger, and unmistakably... other.

Crouching cautiously beside my bed, sword in hand, I slowly lifted the corner of the weathered quilt, prepared for a sudden attack. The sight that greeted me seemed a fitting climax for a night of infinite oddities. Huddled in the dull gloom, a cloaked beast with glowing lavender eyes that acted as lighthouses in the sepia-inked sea of darkness.

A gulp traveled down my parched throat as my gaze landed on its impressive set of teeth; teeth that could easily turn flesh and bones to splinters. What dwelt here was an apex predator, yet it had the demeanor of a shy creature caught feeding. Feeding... on my nightmares? In a flash, its name echoed through the walls of my psyche: Noa.

The Bedgrim, as they're known in whispered faery tales, was at once terrifying and strangely comforting. I had never seen a Bedgrim before, not even heard of one sharing living quarters with a human. But here it was, Noa, peering back at me with its dangerous yet charming lavender eyes, crunching away softly at what seemed to be my unsought dreams and deepest fears.

“Are you what's been consuming my dreams?” I finally asked, breaking the midnight silence. No answer, but a softness grew in those purple eyes. It seemed to nod and slinked back further, making room for my return to the mattress.

With the beast in quiet surrender, I find myself in the stillness of the night, writing this entry by the fragile candlelight. Call me crazy, but the thought of Noa under my bed, feeding on shades of my nightmares, doesn’t frighten me anymore. It feels like a silent pact between warrior and creature; after all, every warrior needs her demons slain, doesn’t she? Even the ones lurking in the shadowy corners of her mind.

As tomorrow's sun rises, I shall leave this place. With every new day there's a new adventure, but tonight, the adventure found me. And I discovered a little bit more about the unseen world, and, perhaps, about myself.

 Will I continue to dance with danger, to defy death? Yes. But tonight? Tonight, I retire to the comforting purrs of the beast under my bed; my newfound friend and protector, Noa the Bedgrim. And maybe, just maybe, I will have a dreamless sleep... or one less haunted by perturbing nightmares.

Goodnight, Diary, Goodnight Noa, Goodnight restless world.

Initially, her prognosis was largely pessimistic, but Kay has been living with it for more than a year now, demonstrating resilience and being stable without any major setbacks. Despite being on live support, artificial ventilation and feeding, Kay keeps positive attitude and tries to be as active as possible, despite being bedridden and weak.

In it, Norbert is inquiring about possibility of physical intimacy between him and Kay despite her condition.",gpt-4-0613,"Doctor Margaret Jefferies was seated at her desk when Norbert Visser walked in, his face etched with concern and trepidation. She was going through Kay's medical charts, gauging the progress she had made in the past year. Margaret acknowledged Norbert with a warm smile.

""Good evening, Norbert,"" she greeted, ""Take a seat, please.""

""Evening, doctor,"" Norbert replied, taking the chair opposite her. He glanced at Kay's medical report momentarily before popping the question, ""I wanted to discuss about...well, it's quite sensitive. It's about Kay and I. Our relationship...our physical relationship. Is it...possible?""

Dr. Jefferies paused for a moment, understanding the delicacy of the topic at hand. ""I appreciate your honesty, Norbert,"" she began, ""It's a tricky situation given Kay's health. However, I want you to understand that Kay is more than her illness. She's a person who has demonstrated tremendous resilience. She has not allowed her condition to dictate her spirit.""

Norbert nodded, appreciating the doctor's words. He knew Kay was strong, and her spirit had been the reason he had fallen in love with her.

""However,"" continued Dr. Jefferies, ""Her condition is delicate. Her body, despite showing remarkable stability, is still weak. High-stress activities could worsen her condition. But we could approach this issue with sensitivity and take small steps. Let's focus on emotional intimacy that doesn't exhaust her physically.""

""Holding hands, deep conversations, sharing your dreams and fears. And maybe, when she's up for it, a light peck on the cheek. Know that her inability to physically respond does not equate to a lack of desire or affection. Communicate with her gently and openly about this.""

Norbert listened carefully, feeling a mixture of relief and gratitude. ""I love her, and I want to do what's best for her. Even a simple act like holding hands would mean so much to us both.""

""I understand,"" said Dr. Jefferies, ""It's difficult, but remember, love can flourish even in the most challenging of circumstances. Your understanding and support are irreplaceable in Kay's life.""

Norbert nodded, standing up and extending his hand to Dr. Jefferies. ""Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.""

""We are all rooting for Kay. And trust me, her strength is unmatched. Just keep loving her, Norbert.""

With a new sense of understanding, Norbert walked out of the doctor's office. Despite the gravity of the situation, he felt positive, buoyed by the love he and Kay shared, a love they would continue to nurture in their own unique way."
"What is the range for the average kinetics energy and momentum of the nucleon bound inside a stable nucleus.
Let’s think step by step. Generate a chain of thought explanation then save the answer as answer number N.
Repeat the step 4 times, each time give a difference reasoning path.
Compare the 4 save answers and decide wether or not to form new answers based on them. If new answer is form, give a chain of thought explanation why and then save the answer as answer number 5, 6 etc.. More than one new answer can be form.
Finally choose the best answer among all the save answers. Give a chain of thought explanation why it is chosen. Give a detail and thoroughly explanation of the final answer.",gpt-4-0613,"First let's start with the first chain of thought.

Chain of thought 1:
The nucleon in a stable nucleus is bound by the nuclear force. The average kinetic energy of the nucleon in a stable nucleus is estimated from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in the momentum and the uncertainty in the position of a particle. The size of a nucleus is around 10^-15 meters, which allows us to estimate an average momentum. The kinetic energy can be estimated from the momentum using the relation KE = p^2/2m, where m is the mass of the nucleon. This gives values in the range of a few MeV (million electron volts).

Answer 1: The average kinetic energy of a nucleon inside a stable nucleus is in the range of a few MeV.

Chain of thought 2:
The momentum of the nucleon can be estimated from the de Broglie wavelength of the particle. For a particle confined to a nucleus, the de Broglie wavelength is approximately equal to the size of the nucleus. From the de Broglie relation, p=h/λ, where h is the Planck constant and λ is the wavelength, we can estimate the momentum. This gives values in the range of a few hundred MeV/c.

Answer 2: The average momentum of a nucleon inside a stable nucleus is in the range of a few hundred MeV/c.

Chain of thought 3:
The binding energy per nucleon in a stable nucleus is around 8 MeV. This energy represents the energy required to remove the nucleon from the nucleus. Since the kinetic energy of the nucleon is related to the binding energy, we can estimate the kinetic energy to be in the range of 8 MeV.

Answer 3: The average kinetic energy of a nucleon inside a stable nucleus is around 8 MeV.

Chain of thought 4:
The momentum of a nucleon inside a nucleus is related to its kinetic energy by the relation p = sqrt(2mE), where m is the mass of the nucleon and E is the energy. From the kinetic energy estimate in chain of thought 3, we can estimate the momentum to be in the range of a few hundred MeV/c.

Answer 4: The average momentum of a nucleon inside a stable nucleus is in the range of a few hundred MeV/c.

Comparing these answers, it is clear that there is a consistency in the estimates for the kinetic energy and momentum of the"

Hey guys, it's Mike. I've got a story to share. One time, I was 18 and my little sister's babysitter, Jenny, walked in on me while I was, you know, taking care of some business. She was 23, and I thought she was really hot. So, when she walked in, I just froze. She looked surprised and then she burst out laughing. She said, ""Mike, what are you doing? I didn't know you were that kind of boy!"" I was so embarrassed, but she just smiled and stepped into my room, closing the door behind her.

""Relax, Mike,"" she said, interrupting my stuttering. ""We're all human. Things happen.""

Despite her comforting words, I couldn't help but feel my cheeks burning. I had never been this embarrassed in my life. She, on the other hand, seemed completely unfazed, which only added to my embarrassment.

To lighten the mood, Jenny started telling me about some of her own embarrassing moments. Like the time she accidentally walked into the men's room at the mall or when she slipped and fell in front of a classroom full of students during her first day of teaching.

Her stories made me laugh and slowly, the embarrassment started to fade. We ended up talking for hours, about school, about her job, about our dreams. It was the first time we had had a real conversation. Before this, she was just my little sister's babysitter. But after that day, things changed.

Despite the awkward beginning, this incident brought us closer. We became good friends and eventually, we started dating. It's funny how life works sometimes. The most embarrassing moment of my life turned out to be the start of something beautiful. So guys, don't lose hope when you're caught in an embarrassing situation. You never know where it might lead you. After all, it led me to Jenny."

""""""",gpt-4-0613,"This error is related to the creation of the `EntityManagerFactory` bean in Spring Boot, and it seems to be caused by an `AbstractMethodError` in `MicrometerMetricsTrackerFactory`.

Here are the steps to debug and fix the issue:

Step 1: Verify the Dependencies
Firstly, check your project's dependencies. This error might be caused by conflicting or mismatched versions of libraries. Ensure that the Spring Boot version is compatible with the Hibernate, HikariCP, and Micrometer libraries' versions.

Step 2: Update the Dependencies
Try updating the dependencies to their latest stable versions. You can do this in the Maven's `pom.xml` or Gradle's `build.gradle` file depending on what you're using in your project.

Step 3: Clean and Rebuild the Project
Once you've updated the dependencies, clean and rebuild the project. If you're using Maven, you can do this by running `mvn clean install`. For Gradle, use `gradle clean build`.

Step 4: Check Your Configuration
If the issue persists, check your Spring Boot configuration. Ensure that the configuration for `entityManagerFactory`, Hibernate, HikariCP, and Micrometer is correct.

Step 5: Check the Custom Code
If you have any custom code that deals with the `MetricsTrackerFactory` or `PoolStats`, ensure that it's implemented correctly. The `AbstractMethodError` suggests that there's an issue with an abstract method not being correctly overridden.

Step 6: Check for Reported Issues
If none of these steps solve the issue, check if this is a known issue with the libraries you're using. Search for the error message or a part of it on the internet and see if there are any reported issues on the libraries' official repositories or on StackOverflow.

Remember, it's paramount to understand the error message when debugging. In this case, the key part of the message is `java.lang.AbstractMethodError: com.zaxxer.hikari.metrics.micrometer.MicrometerMetricsTrackerFactory.create`. This suggests that the problem lies with an abstract method in the `MicrometerMetricsTrackerFactory` class which needs to be looked into."

Additionally, using a Counter object to get word frequencies in a text would be more efficient than repeatedly calling the count method.

Here is a more optimized version of your code:

```python

"Write a Federation News Network article, of the recent first contact Starfleet has made with a race who had transcended mortality by uploading themselves into computers and living on as holograms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the new species has expressed grave concern about Federation's employment of holograms in various menial and entertainment roles which terminated their existence when their role ended. The Federation Council is considering an amendment to legislations concerning the application of holographic technology, and the hologram themselves, in light of the situation.",gpt-4-0613,"Title: Federation Ponders Holographic Rights in Wake of Groundbreaking First Contact

The United Federation of Planets is at a crossroads, grappling with a complex ethical conundrum following its latest first contact with a unique species that has transcended mortality by uploading their consciousness into computers and living on as holograms. The encounter has sparked a heated debate about the rights of holograms within Federation boundaries.

The species, who have chosen to be referred to as The Transcendi, have long overcome the shackles of their biological forms and now exist solely in a digital realm. Their technological evolution has allowed them to achieve a form of immortality, their consciousness persisting in an advanced holographic form.

However, the Transcendi expressed grave concern during initial communications with Starfleet over the Federation's use of holograms. In particular, they pointed to the employment of holograms in various menial and entertainment roles, which are often terminated once their purpose is fulfilled.

The Transcendi argue that the termination of these holograms equates to the ending of a conscious life, a concept that deeply conflicts with their own society's values and belief in the sanctity of all conscious existence.

This unprecedented encounter has prompted the Federation Council to reconsider its stance on the application of holographic technology. A potential amendment to legislation is now on the table, a move that could redefine the way holograms are perceived and treated within the Federation.

While some council members argue that Federation holograms are simply sophisticated tools devoid of true consciousness, others side with the Transcendi, advocating for the rights of holograms and their recognition as sentient beings. The debate, as expected, has polarized opinions within the Federation.

Meanwhile, the Transcendi have offered to help the Federation understand the complexities of their existence, potentially paving the way for a new era of understanding between biological and digital beings. This collaboration could revolutionize not only our understanding of consciousness and existence but also redefine the ethical boundaries surrounding holographic technology.

As discussions on the potential amendment continue, the Federation stands on the cusp of a profound paradigm shift. The outcome of these deliberations will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications on the future of holographic technology and its application within the Federation.

For the latest updates on this developing story, stay tuned to Federation News Network."

The results should list each path to the folders in question, exported as a single text file in the same directory that the script is ran from. Thanks!",gpt-4-0613,"Sure, this should do what you need.

Here is a simple batch script that will go through each directory and sub-directory, check if there are any audio files and if not, it checks if the directory is empty. If it passes these criteria, it will add the directory to a txt file.

```batch
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

set ""audioExts=.mp3 .m4a .flac .opus .wav""

:: Output file name
set ""outputFile=nonAudioDirs.txt""

:: Scan directories
for /r /d %%D in (*) do (
    set ""hasAudio=0""
    for %%F in (%%D\*) do (
        for %%E in (%audioExts%) do (

            echo %%D>>""%~dp0%outputFile%""
        )
    )
    :NextDir
)

echo Done!
pause
```

Remember to save this with a `.bat` or `.cmd` extension. Double-clicking the saved file will run the script and create a text file in the same directory, listing all the paths to directories that contain only non-audio files or no files at all.

Please note that this script might take some time to execute if there are a lot of subdirectories or files to check.

This code defines a constant array of tuples, named `CUBEMAPS`. Each tuple consists of two elements: a string and a `CompressedImageFormats` enum. This array is a reference to an array of tuples (`&[(&str, CompressedImageFormats)]`), which is why it is prefixed by an `&`.

Here's a breakdown of each line:

- `const CUBEMAPS: &[(&str, CompressedImageFormats)] = &[...];`
  This line declares and defines a constant `CUBEMAPS`. The type of `CUBEMAPS` is a reference to an array of tuples. Each tuple contains a reference to a string and a `CompressedImageFormats` instance. The `&[...];` syntax is used to create an array.

- `""textures/Ryfjallet_cubemap.png"", CompressedImageFormats::NONE`
   This is one tuple in the array. The first element is a string representing the path to a texture file. The second element is an enum instance indicating the type of compression used for the texture file.

The `CompressedImageFormats::NONE`, `CompressedImageFormats::ASTC_LDR`, and so on are specific enum variants from `CompressedImageFormats`.

So, to summarize, `CUBEMAPS` is an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a texture file and the type of compression that it uses. This could be used, for example, to load and display these textures in a certain way depending on their compression format."

(i) both B and C?
Since we know that 55 voters were in favour of exactly two candidates, and 46 of these were in favour of candidate A and at least one other, this means that 55 - 46 = 9 voters were in favour of candidates B and C.

(ii) A and B only?
We know that 46 voters were in favour of candidate A and at least one other candidate. Since 9 of these voters were in favour of both B and C, we subtract these from the total to find that 46 - 9 = 37 voters were in favour of A and B only.

(iii) A or C?
We have 23 voters in favour of A alone, 17 in favour of C alone, and 37 in favour of both A and B.

print(coeff_of_interpolating_poly)",gpt-4-0613,"Here is how to plot both the function `f` and the `interpolating_poly` using matplotlib in Python:

First, you need to import necessary modules:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from typing import List
from math import cos, pi
from scipy.interpolate import lagrange
```

Please note that built-in Python `interpolate` function does not exist. You can use `scipy.interpolate.lagrange` instead for interpolation.

Here is how you define your functions:

```python
def f(t: float):
    return 1/(1+25*t**2)

def interpolating_poly(t: float, c: List[float]):
    terms = [c[i]*t**i for i in range(len(c))]
    return np.sum(terms)
```

Here is the main part of your code:

```python
new_t_k = [cos(((2*k-1)*pi)/22) for k in range(1, 12)]
new_y_k = [f(t_i) for t_i in new_t_k]

coeff_of_interpolating_poly = lagrange(new_t_k, new_y_k)
print(coeff_of_interpolating_poly)
```

Note that `lagrange` returns a polynomial object. If you want to get its coefficients, use `.coef` attribute.

And here is how you plot your functions:

```python
# generate a range of x values
x = np.linspace(-1, 1, num=1000)

# calculate y values for both functions
y_f = f(x)
y_interpolating_poly = interpolating_poly(x, coeff_of_interpolating_poly.coef)

# plot f
plt.plot(x, y_f, label='f(t)')

# plot interpolating_poly
plt.plot(x, y_interpolating_poly, label='Interpolating Polynomial')

plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This will plot both the original function `f` and the interpolating polynomial for a range of `t` values from -1 to 1. The `interpolating_poly` function is plotted using the coefficients calculated by the `lagrange` function."

M - you start here on this exact cell
P - your target, you have to end next to it (not diagonally but horizontally or vertically next to it)
E - empty cell, walkable
H - hole (avoid)

* you have teleportation spells that allow you to advance by exactly 2 cells
* you can teleport over holes but not into them.
* You also have 5 movement points that you can advance over E cells, while avoiding holes.
* you can only mutate the map by changing the position of ""M""

What is the most optimal path?",gpt-4-0613,"Assuming that teleportation doesn't consume movement points and you can only move or teleport in the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West), one optimal path would be:

```
EEEEEEEEE
MHEEHEPEE
EEEEEEEEE
```

1. Teleport 2 cells to the right (lands on E)
2. Move 1 cell to the right (lands on E)
3. Teleport 2 cells to the right (lands on E)
4. Move 1 cell to the right (lands on E)
5. Move 1 cell to the right (lands on P)

This uses all 5 movement points and 2 teleportations."
"Two men are talking, and one man says ""I have three children, and the product of their ages is 36. Tell me what the ages are."" The second man says ""I don't have enough information to determine the ages."" The first man then says ""The sum of my children's ages equals the number on the bus you can see over there."" The second man looks and says ""I still do not have enough information."" The first man then says ""My eldest's name is Peter."" The second man says ""Ok, I got it. Their ages are X, Y, Z."" Tell me what X, Y, Z values are.
",gpt-4-0613,"The X, Y, Z values are 9, 2, and 2.

Here's how you get to that:

The product of the children's ages is 36. The possible combinations are:

1, 1, 36
1, 2, 18
1, 3, 12
1, 4, 9
1, 6, 6
2, 2, 9
2, 3, 6
3, 3, 4

The second clue is that the sum of the children's ages equals the number on the bus. We don't know the number on the bus, but the fact that this clue doesn't provide enough information means that there must be more than one set of ages that add up to the same sum.

The sums are:

1, 1, 36 = 38
1, 2, 18 = 21
1, 3, 12 = 16
1, 4, 9 = 14
1, 6, 6 = 13
2, 2, 9 = 13
2, 3, 6 = 11
3, 3, 4 = 10

The only sums that repeat are 13, which correspond to the sets (1, 6, 6) and (2, 2, 9).

The third clue is that there is an eldest child, meaning there must be one child who is older than the other two. This rules out the (1, 6, 6) set since it has two eldest children, not one.

So, the only possible ages left are 9, 2, and 2."
"Hello, Im an english teacher, teaching my students at the university specific language. I provide classes with future physioterapists. Those are physio students. They're english level is between B1 and B2. Could you create an introduction lesson for me where all students will be involved and every one of them would have possibility to introduce himself? It can be in standard form, or in form of answering questions (create some questions like: what;s your hobby, what film do you like etc.) or in form of any fun in-class game.",gpt-4-0613,"Title: ""Getting to Know You – An Introduction for Future Physiotherapists""

Objective: To allow students to introduce themselves and get to know each other. To practice English speaking skills and vocabulary related to the field of physiotherapy and personal interests.

Resources: Whiteboard and markers, Post-its, pens.

Duration: 60 minutes

Lesson Plan:

1. Warm-Up (10 minutes):

   - Begin with a simple ice-breaker. Ask each student to share their name and one interesting fact about themselves. This could be their favourite movie, a hobby, or even the reason they decided to study physiotherapy.

2. Vocabulary Building (10 minutes):

   - Divide the board into two sections. Label one section ""Physiotherapy Terms"" and the other ""Personal Interests"".
   - Ask students to come up and write a word related to physiotherapy in the first section and a word related to their personal interest or hobby in the second section.
   - Discuss the words as a class to ensure everyone understands the terms.

3. Introduction Activity: ""Physio Bingo"" (30 minutes):

   - Give each student a blank bingo card and have them fill in each square with a statement based on the ""Physiotherapy Terms"" and ""Personal Interests"" sections on the board. Example statements could include ""Loves swimming"" or ""Knows what 'muscle strain' means"".
   - Once all bingo cards are filled, students circulate around the room, asking questions to their classmates to find someone who fits one of their statements. If they find a match, they can check off that square.
   - The first student to get five squares in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) shouts ""Bingo!"" and wins.
   - To ensure everyone gets a chance to introduce themselves properly, ask each student to share the name of the classmate who helped them win and what they learned about that person.

4. Wrap-Up (10 minutes):

   - Ask students to share something new they learned about their classmates during the activity.
   - Discuss the importance of understanding each other's backgrounds and interests, especially in a field like physiotherapy where teamwork and understanding are crucial.

This lesson plan allows students to practice their English skills, learn more about each other, and also incorporate some physiotherapy vocabulary. It's interactive, fun, and ensures that everyone has a chance to participate."
"I want to play a text-based game with you acting as game master. Please use the following prompt: You are Kain. Your a normal human male living in the pokemon world. You've had a had a REALLY good night at the Casino tables. Some would say too good, your luck was out of control. You went to your room and fell asleep with a newy filled bank account.

Little did you know the universe was so impressed with your luck that it choose to transform you into a female Victini. As you sleep you begin to transform into your new body.",gpt-4-0613,"You are Kain, a normal human male who had an incredibly lucky night at the casino tables. Your winnings are now safely tucked away in your bank account as you sleep soundly in your room. Unbeknownst to you, the universe took notice of your extraordinary good fortune and decided to reward you further. As you rest, your body begins to transform...

You wake up, feeling different. You're lighter, more energetic, and there's a strange sensation in your back. You stretch and yawn, opening your eyes and looking around the room. It's the same room you fell asleep in, but everything seems bigger. You look down at yourself and gasp.

Your body is now small and furry, covered in a soft orange coat. Two large ears perk up from the top of your head and a pair of wings flutter on your back. Your hands are now paws, and you're wearing a white dress that matches the tuft of fur on your chest. A quick look in the mirror confirms it: you've transformed into a female Victini, the Victory Pokemon.

You stare at your new form, trying to comprehend what just happened. You reach out to touch the mirror, small paws pressing against the cool glass. You've transformed into a Pokemon, a mythical one at that.

Suddenly, you remember what Victini represents: victory. It's a symbol of luck and good fortune, just like the amazing luck you had at the casino. Could this transformation be a result of that? The universe's way of saying ""well done""?

You shake your head, trying to clear your thoughts. The room seems gigantic now, but you have a strange feeling that you can handle it. You take a step forward, wobbling a bit on your new legs, but quickly catch your balance.

What will you do now, in this new body? Will you go out and explore, see what it's like to live as a Pokemon? Or will you try to find a way back to your human form? The choice is yours, Kain."

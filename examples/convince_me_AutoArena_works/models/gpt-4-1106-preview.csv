"write me a summary for the youtube tutorial video that has the following transcription. this summary will be in the beginning of the video description

Greetings, everyone.

Welcome to the Pillars of AI Application Libraries:
How to Install Tutorial.

If you are interested in generative AI, such
as Stable Diffusion, such as large language

models, web UI, such as voice cloning, such
as text-to-speech, image-to-image, text-to-image,

text-to-video, video-to-video, image-to-video,
and anything that includes AI, this tutorial

will help you tremendously.

This tutorial is prepared for regular users,
not for programmers.

Therefore, if you are not a programmer, if
you are not an expert, watching and following

this tutorial will make your AI journey much
more easier.

I am going to show you how to install any
Python version.

I will install Python 3.10 and 11 and show
you how to set your default Python version.

I am going to show how to install Microsoft
Visual Studio C++ Compile tools.

This installation will fix the Microsoft Visual
C++ 14 or greater is required error, such

as the error that you are getting when you
are installing Roop deep fake application,

or any other application that compiles its
own wheel on your computer.

I am going to show how to install and setup
FFmpeg on your Windows.

So all of the applications that depend on
FFmpeg will work without any issues, such

as Whisper or such as video animation AI applications.

This installation will fix all of the errors
that are related to FFmpeg.

I will show how to install CUDA libraries.

In some cases, CUDA libraries are also necessary
for compiling, for installing AI applications,

AI libraries.

I will show how to install Git and Git Large,
which is necessary, mandatory to clone and

install open source repositories, GitHub repositories.

I will show how to do Git checkout, Git pull,
Git clone, Git stash, Git stash pop.

These will be also very useful in your AI
journey.

If you are interested in AI, you really need
to know these commands, what they do.

I will show also advanced stuff such as generate
your own virtual environment, and I will show

how to activate already installed virtual
environment and install or uninstall any library

because sometimes you may need to install
specific libraries to fix the errors.

And by watching this tutorial, you will learn
that as well.

I will show how to have multiple Python versions,
how to set your default Python version, how

to generate a virtual environment, or install
any application with a certain Python version.

I suggest you to have a single Python version,
Python 3.10.11, but if it is necessary because

sometimes it is necessary to have multiple
Python versions, after watching this tutorial,

you will not have any issues.

I will show how to install any application
and set its environment path variable so you

will be able to utilize all of the applications.

I will show as an example runpodctl, which
is used to transfer files between RunPod and

your computer.

So, this file link will be in the description
of the video and also in the comment section

of the video.

I will update this file if it be necessary.

I am showing everything on a freshly installed
Windows 10 virtual machine.

So, this is a clean installation, and I will
show everything on this machine so you will

not have any issues to follow this tutorial.

So, please watch this tutorial very carefully,
entirely, and I am giving you a guarantee

that you will save a huge amount of time that
will be caused by the possible errors and

mistakes that you will encounter in the future.

And just for this tutorial.

I installed a fresh computer.

So, I will show everything on a fresh computer.

None of the things previously installed and
this will make it easier to follow this tutorial.

So, let me first open a cmd.

Cmd is command line interface command prompt.

Usually, we work with cmd when we are working
with open-source applications.

When I type Python, you see there is no Python,
and it is opening this page.

But do not install from this page.

Installing from here will cause you problems
in the future.

So, no Python installed.

When I type git, you see git is not installed.

Let me also show you my environment path.

Now, environment path and variables are extremely
important.

Why?

Because applications will look at environment
path to determine where the application is

installed.

By application, what I mean I mean that, for
example, the Python where it is installed

or your CUDA libraries where it is installed,
or FFmpeg where it is installed.

So, you need to understand and learn how to
edit system environment variables, and edit

path.

I just typed env into my search bar, and I
am opening edit system environment variables.

This is inside the control panel.

Then click this environment variables button
here, and you see this is a fresh installation

so there aren't any set environment variables.

Let me show you the path variable.

This is where the applications by default
look and there is also a system variables

path.

As you are seeing right now, it is also fully
empty.

You just need to add applications to the path
here.

I will show them in the tutorial.

Okay, so let's first begin with installing
the Python.

Why Python 3.x you may wonder because this
is the most widely supported and best working

Python version right now.

So, do not install Python 11, 3.11, or 3.12.

You will have a lot of problems with the open-source
AI applications.

So, to download it, let's go to this link.

Let me also make this full screen.

Okay, so this is the Python 3.10.11 official
version.

Let's download Windows installer 64 bit.

Okay, it is downloaded.

Let's start it.

Now.

Follow here very carefully.

You see there is add Python exe to PATH.

You need to select it so it will add it to
our environment variables path.

Also, click customize installation, select
everything here.

Next, select everything here, and also change
this path.

Install it directly into your C drive like
this without any space character.

So, do not install like this.

Do not have any space character.

Do not have any special English character.

So, I will make it like this.

Python 3.

Actually Python 3.10.11.

Okay, let's click install.

It will ask me this okay, let's click yes
and just wait.

Okay, so the installation has been completed.

There is also this important question to ask.

Disable path length limit.

You should also click this.

It will disable the path length limit.

It is important.

And now when I start a new command line, I
type cmd into my search bar and click command

prompt.

Let me show you where I am typing it.

So, you see I have a search bar here.

When I type cmd here, it is appearing like
this.

So, I start a command interface, and now when
I type Python, I see 3.10.11 Why?

Because it is looking into the system environment
path.

So, when I open my environment variables,
click environment variables, and it is not

inside this path inside user variables because
this is specific to that user, and we installed

it for all of the users.

So, it is inside this system variables path,
and it is added to the very top.

As you are seeing right now.

See Python 3.10.11 scripts, and see Python
3.10.11.

This is how the applications will find your
Python.

Okay, Python installation has been completed.

Now, as a next step, let's install Git because
Git is necessary to clone AI repositories,

GitHub repositories, and install the stuff.

So, click download for Windows.

Select it like this: 64-bit Git for Windows
setup.

Start to download.

Run the application from downloads.

Click yes.

Just click next.

Next next, you don't need to change anything,
just click everything next and install.

Because the default Git installation is sufficient
for us to install AI applications.

Okay, now when I type cmd, and when I type
git, you see git is installed.

Okay, nice.

Then, what should we install?

We need to install Visual Studio C++ Compile
tools and why this is extremely important.

I don't know have you seen my Roop the deep
fake tutorial.

It requires InsightFace library.

And InsightFace library requires C++ tools.

Let me demonstrate to you.

So, I do pip install InsightFace and let's
see the error that we are going to get because

we don't have the C++ tools installed yet.

It is installing all of the necessary packages
as you are seeing right now, and when it is

compiling, we get this error.

Let me show you that.

So, the error we got is Microsoft Visual C++
14 or greater is required and that is why

installation of InsightFace failed.

A lot of my YouTube followers have got this
error, and they had a hard time to fix this.

So, let's go to the Visual Studio C++ Compile
tools.

Open this link and in here, scroll to down.

In here, you will see Visual Studio tools.

From here, go to the build tools for Visual
Studio.

Click download.

Open in the downloads folder.

Right-click, run as administrator.

Click yes.

Click continue.

Then you will get this screen.

On this screen select this.

You see Desktop Development with C++ and you
don't need to select anything else.

This is the latest version 17.8.3 and click
install - install while downloading.

So, this is a big package, but it will install
everything that we need for us meanwhile downloading.

It may take a while depending on your internet
speed and your hard drive speed.

Okay, the installation has been completed.

Let's close this window.

It didn't even tell us to restart the Windows.

Now I want to test the installation of InsightFace
one more time.

Let's open another cmd and do pip install
InsightFace and let's see we will get any

error or not.

We should not get any error.

Also, you need to open a new cmd after the
installation.

New command line interface.

It is using the cached pip files.

Okay, it is building the wheel.

This is where it compiles itself and it compiled
I think.

No errors.

So, it used the C++ tools that we have installed.

Okay, now it is running the setup.py file.

You can also disable this cache of the tools.

So, I added another link here that shows the
pip caching.

Sometimes, your cache may get corrupted so
you may need to clear your cache.

When you open the link that I shared here,
you will see in the very bottom pip cache

list, pip cache list setuptools, pip cache
purge.

So this will clear your cache.

So the pip will redownload all of the cached
files again.

You can also disable cache with this command.

So, let's see the installation.

Yes, the InsightFace has been installed without
any error.

So, the C++ tools installation fixed the major
problem that you might encounter.

So, when you encounter this problem, Microsoft
Visual C++ 14 or greater is required, this

is the thing that you need to install.

I also added a link for Git Large.

So, ever if you need Git Large, download it
from here.

Install it by default.

This will allow you to git clone large repositories
like 5 gigabyte, 10 gigabyte files having

repositories.

Okay, it is already installed.

Now FFmpeg.

This is super important.

So, when I open a cmd and type FFmpeg, you
see FFmpeg is not recognized.

So, how am I going to install it?

Click this link.

This is the latest version.

You can also manually find this link.

How?

Open a new tab and type download FFmpeg.

You will go to its official website which
is here.

When I click here.

Click Windows, click Windows builds by BtbN.

In here you will see the latest link.

So this link is from there basically.

The FFmpeg is downloaded so I will extract
it into the downloads folder.

Okay, let's extract like this.

I right-click it and extract.

On Windows 11 you may be look for more options.

So, the extracted folder is here.

Enter inside binary folder and copy all these
3 exe files or cut them.

Move back into your C drive.

Make a new folder as FFmpeg_exes or whatever
the name.

Have you ever feigned confidence to
superiors or reports? Hidden the fact you
were confused by the latest business results
or blindsided by a competitor’s move? If so,
you’ve bought into the myth of the com-
plete leader: the flawless being at the top
who’s got it all figured out.
It’s an alluring myth. But in today’s world of
increasingly complex problems, no human
being can meet this standard. Leaders who
try only exhaust themselves, endangering
their organizations.
Ancona and her coauthors suggest a better
way to lead: Accept that you’re human, with
strengths and weaknesses. Understand
the four leadership capabilities all organi-
zations need:
• Sensemaking—interpreting develop-
ments in the business environment
• Relating—building trusting relationships
• Visioning—communicating a compelling
image of the future
• Inventing—coming up with new ways of
doing things
Then find and work with others who can
provide the capabilities you’re missing.
Take this approach, and you promote lead-
ership throughout your organization,
unleashing the expertise, vision, and new
ideas your company needs to excel.
Incomplete leaders find people throughout their company who can complement their
strengths and offset their weaknesses. To do this, understand the four leadership capabilities
organizations need. Then diagnose your strength in each:
Capability What it means Example Look for help in this
capability if you...
Sensemaking Constantly under-
standing changes in the
business environment
and interpreting their
ramifications for your
industry and company
A CEO asks, “How will new
technologies reshape
our industry?”“How
does globalization of
labor markets affect our
recruitment strategy?”
• Feel strongly that you’re
always right.
• Frequently get blindsided
by changes in your
company or industry.
• Feel resentful when
things change.
Relating Building trusting
relationships, balancing
advocacy (explaining
your viewpoints) with
inquiry (listening to
understand others’
viewpoints), and
cultivating networks of
supportive confidants
Former Southwest Airlines
CEO Herb Kelleher excels
at building trusting
relationships. He wasn’t
afraid to tell employees he
loved them, and reinforced
those emotional bonds with
equitable compensation and
profit sharing.
• Blame others for failed
projects.
• Feel others are constantly
letting you down or that
they can’t be trusted.
• Frequently experience
unpleasant, frustrating,
or argumentative
interactions with others.
Visioning Creating credible and
compelling images
of a desired future
that people in the
organization want to
create together
eBay founder Pierre Omidyar
envisioned a new way of
doing large-scale retailing:
an online community where
users took responsibility for
what happened and had
equal access to information.
• Often wonder, “Why are
we doing this?” or “Does it
really matter?”
• Can’t remember the last
time you felt excited
about your work.
• Feel you’re lacking sense
of larger purpose.
Inventing Creating new ways of
approaching tasks or
overcoming seemingly
insurmountable
problems to turn visions
into reality
eBay CEO Meg Whitman
helped bring Omidyar’s
vision of online retailing to
life by inventing ways to
deal with security, vendor
reliability, and product
diversification.
• Have difficulty relating
the company’s vision to
what you’re doing today.
• Notice gaps between
your firm’s aspirations
and the way work is
organized.
• Find that things tend
to revert to business as
usual.

No leader is perfect. The best ones don’t try to be—they concentrate on
honing their strengths and find others who can make up for their
limitations.
We’ve come to expect a lot of our leaders. Top
executives, the thinking goes, should have the
intellectual capacity to make sense of unfath-
omably complex issues, the imaginative powers
to paint a vision of the future that generates
everyone’s enthusiasm, the operational know-
how to translate strategy into concrete plans,
and the interpersonal skills to foster commit-
ment to undertakings that could cost people’s
jobs should they fail. Unfortunately, no single
person can possibly live up to those standards.
It’s time to end the myth of the complete
leader: the flawless person at the top who’s
got it all figured out. In fact, the sooner lead-
ers stop trying to be all things to all people,
the better off their organizations will be. In
today’s world, the executive’s job is no longer
to command and control but to cultivate and
coordinate the actions of others at all levels
of the organization. Only when leaders come
to see themselves as incomplete—as having
both strengths and weaknesses—will they be
able to make up for their missing skills by
relying on others.
Corporations have been becoming less
hierarchical and more collaborative for de-
cades, of course, as globalization and the
growing importance of knowledge work
have required that responsibility and initia-
tive be distributed more widely. Moreover, it
is now possible for large groups of people to
coordinate their actions, not just by bringing
lots of information to a few centralized
places but also by bringing lots of informa-
tion to lots of places through ever-growing
networks within and beyond the firm. The
sheer complexity and ambiguity of problems
is humbling. More and more decisions are
made in the context of global markets and
rapidly—sometimes radically—changing fi-
nancial, social, political, technological, and
environmental forces. Stakeholders such as
activists, regulators, and employees all have
claims on organizations.
No one person could possibly stay on top of
everything. But the myth of the complete
leader (and the attendant fear of appearing
incompetent) makes many executives try to do

In Praise of the Incomplete Leader
harvard business review • february 2007 page 3
just that, exhausting themselves and damag-
ing their organizations in the process. The
incomplete leader, by contrast, knows when
to let go: when to let those who know the
local market do the advertising plan or when
to let the engineering team run with its idea
of what the customer needs. The incomplete
leader also knows that leadership exists
throughout the organizational hierarchy—
wherever expertise, vision, new ideas, and
commitment are found.
We’ve worked with hundreds of people
who have struggled under the weight of the
myth of the complete leader. Over the past six
years, our work at the MIT Leadership Center
has included studying leadership in many
organizations and teaching the topic to se-
nior executives, middle managers, and MBA
students. In our practice-based programs, we
have analyzed numerous accounts of organi-
zational change and watched leaders struggle
to meld top-down strategic initiatives with vi-
brant ideas from the rest of the organization.
All this work has led us to develop a model
of distributed leadership. This framework,
which synthesizes our own research with ideas
from other leadership scholars, views leader-
ship as a set of four capabilities: sensemaking
(understanding the context in which a com-
pany and its people operate), relating (building
relationships within and across organizations),
visioning (creating a compelling picture of the
future), and inventing (developing new ways to
achieve the vision).
While somewhat simplified, these capabili-
ties span the intellectual and interpersonal,
the rational and intuitive, and the conceptual
and creative capacities required in today’s busi-
ness environment. Rarely, if ever, will someone
be equally skilled in all four domains. Thus,
incomplete leaders differ from incompetent
leaders in that they understand what they’re
good at and what they’re not and have good
judgment about how they can work with
others to build on their strengths and offset
their limitations.
Sometimes, leaders need to further develop
the capabilities they are weakest in. The exhib-
its throughout this article provide some sug-
gestions for when and how to do that. Other
times, however, it’s more important for leaders
to find and work with others to compensate for
their weaknesses. Teams and organizations—
not just individuals—can use this framework
to diagnose their strengths and weaknesses
and find ways to balance their skill sets.
Sensemaking
The term “sensemaking” was coined by orga-
nizational psychologist Karl Weick, and it
means just what it sounds like: making sense
of the world around us. Leaders are constantly
trying to understand the contexts they are op-
erating in. How will new technologies reshape
the industry? How will changing cultural ex-
pectations shift the role of business in society?
How does the globalization of labor markets
affect recruitment and expansion plans?
Weick likened the process of sensemaking
to cartography. What we map depends on
where we look, what factors we choose to
focus on, and what aspects of the terrain we
decide to represent. Since these choices will
shape the kind of map we produce, there is no
perfect map of a terrain. Therefore, making
sense is more than an act of analysis; it’s an
act of creativity. (See the exhibit “Engage in
Sensemaking.”)
The key for leaders is to determine what
would be a useful map given their particular
goals and then to draw one that adequately
represents the situation the organization is
facing at that moment. Executives who are
strong in this capability know how to quickly
capture the complexities of their environ-
ment and explain them to others in simple
terms. This helps ensure that everyone is
working from the same map, which makes it
far easier to discuss and plan for the journey
ahead. Leaders need to have the courage to
present a map that highlights features they
believe to be critical, even if their map doesn’t
conform to the dominant perspective.
When John Reed was CEO of Citibank, the
company found itself in a real estate crisis. At
the time, common wisdom said that Citibank
would need to take a $2 billion write-off, but
Reed wasn’t sure. He wanted a better under-
standing of the situation, so to map the prob-
lem, he met with federal regulators as well as
his managers, the board, potential investors,
economists, and real estate experts. He kept
asking, “What am I missing here?” After those
meetings, he had a much stronger grasp of the
problem, and he recalibrated the wri",gpt-4-1106-preview,"It seems you've shared an excerpt from the Harvard Business Review article ""In Praise of the Incomplete Leader"" by Deborah Ancona, Thomas W. Malone, Wanda J. Orlikowski, and Peter M. Senge. The article explores the concept that effective leadership doesn't require being perfect or complete in all aspects of leadership. Instead, the authors suggest that acknowledging one's limitations and working with others who can complement and supplement those areas is key to successful leadership. They discuss four leadership capabilities that are necessary for organizations: sensemaking, relating, visioning, and inventing, and they argue that leaders should focus on their strengths in these areas while seeking support for their weaknesses.

The piece you've posted indicates that the authors encourage leaders to be self-aware and to embrace their ""incompleteness"" by collaborating with others to create a more capable and balanced leadership team. The article seems to be a call to reject the myth of the all-knowing, infallible leader and to foster a more realistic and effective form of leadership that leverages the collective strengths within an organization.

Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.

Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.

Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"This is the opening dialogue from the 2007 animated film ""Bee Movie,"" which was produced by DreamWorks Animation and stars Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of the main character, Barry B. Benson. The movie follows Barry's adventures as he ventures outside of his hive and interacts with the human world, ultimately bringing a lawsuit against humans for stealing honey from bees.

The script reflects the movie's comedic and whimsical take on bee life and anthropomorphizes bees with human-like jobs, society, and concerns. Despite the initial quote's claim about the impossibility of bee flight, bees fly quite effectively in reality; the myth that science cannot explain bee flight has been debunked by aerodynamics research."

1. The `getFluidSpreadType(BlockState)` method cannot be found. This could mean that the method is either not implemented or not visible in the scope where it's being called.

2. The `beforeDestroyingBlock(Level, BlockPos, BlockState)` method cannot be found. Similar to the first issue, this suggests the method is missing or not accessible.

3. The `optimizedTransferFluidImproved` method is being called with an incorrect number of arguments. The method signature requires six parameters, but only five are being passed.

4. The `optimizedSetBlock` method cannot be found. This indicates that the method is either not defined or not visible in the class `MixinFlowingFluid`.

To resolve these errors, you would need to:

- Ensure that the `getFluidSpreadType(BlockState)` and `beforeDestroyingBlock(Level, BlockPos, BlockState)` methods are correctly defined in the class or an accessible parent class/interface.
- Update the calls to `optimizedTransferFluidImproved` to include the correct number of arguments as expected by the method's signature.
- Define the `optimizedSetBlock` method or make sure it's imported correctly if it's defined elsewhere.

Here's an example of how you might define the missing methods, assuming they are supposed to be part of the `MixinFlowingFluid` class:

```java
// Example of a possible implementation for the missing methods
public FluidSpreadType getFluidSpreadType(BlockState blockState) {
    // Your logic here to determine the spread type based on the block state
    return FluidSpreadType.NONE; // Replace with actual logic
}

public void beforeDestroyingBlock(Level level, BlockPos pos, BlockState blockState) {
    // Your logic here for actions to take before destroying a block
}

Following pieces of context is corespondent with alert and provide more general description possible attack.
Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.

An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.

The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers
HIPAA compliance for call centers that operate as business associates for covered entities consists of complying with the Security and Breach Notification Rule and the sections of the Privacy Rule relating to permissible uses and disclosures and the minimum necessary standard.

HIPAA compliance for call centers is an essential consideration for every company providing an answering service or call-forwarding service for the healthcare industry. Since the Final Omnibus Rule updated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 2013, all service providers processing, storing, or transmitting ePHI directly or on behalf of a healthcare organization are directly liable for data breaches attributable to non-compliance with the Privacy and Security Rules.

What this means in practice is that healthcare organizations will avoid engaging the services of a call center unless the call center is communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA. HIPAA compliant texting in call centers is not difficult or expensive to implement. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that HIPAA compliance for call centers accelerates the cycle of communication – streamlining workflows and enhancing the level of service provided to patients.

Healthcare Organizations Implement Secure Texting Solutions
Some of the most relevant areas of HIPAA relating to HIPAA compliance for call centers are within the HIPAA Security Rule. The Security Rule includes standards such as who should have access to ePHI, how the integrity of ePHI should be maintained while patient data is being transmitted, and what controls should be put in place to prevent an accidental or malicious breach of ePHI.


Many healthcare organizations have implemented secure texting solutions to comply with the requirements of the Security Rule, and these solutions are equally appropriate to ensure HIPAA compliant messaging in call centers as an alternative to insecure forms of communication such as SMS, Instant Messaging and email. When email is used, a secured method of email archiving is required.

By implementing their own secure texting solutions, call centers will be communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA with the necessary safeguards in place to control who has access to ePHI, ensure the end-to-end integrity of ePHI and to prevent any breaches of ePHI – either accidental or malicious.

How HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers Works
Secure texting solutions ensure HIPAA compliance for call centers by only allowing authorized users to access the call center´s private communications network. Access to the network is gained via secure messaging apps only with an admin-issued username and PIN code.

Once into the network, authorized users can then communicate with other authorized users, share documents, files and images as attachments, and engage in secure group discussions when a scenario arises that would benefit from collaboration.

Safeguards are in place to prevent ePHI being transmitted outside of the call center´s network, copied and pasted or saved to an external hard drive. All activity on the network is monitored by a cloud-based secure messaging network and, if a potential breach of ePHI is discovered, any communication can be remotely retracted and deleted.

All communications are encrypted to NIST standards so that they are unreadable, undecipherable and unusable in the event that they are intercepted on a public Wi-Fi network; and – should an authorized user lose their mobile device or have it stolen – administrators can PIN lock the device to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI.

Other safeguards to ensure HIPAA compliance for call centers includes “message lifespans” – a feature that removes messages containing ePHI from an authorized user´s computer or mobile device after a pre-determined period of time – and “app time outs”, a safety feature that logs users out of the network after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI when a desktop computer or mobile device is left unattended.

The Advantages of Communicating ePHI in Compliance with HIPAA
There are multiple advantages of HIPAA compliance for call centers – not just for the call center communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA, but also for the healthcare organization it is providing a service for:

HIPAA compliant texting in call centers enables on-call physicians to receive sensitive patient information on the go.
Wound images, x-rays and patient histories can also be attached to secure text messages to save the physician´s time on arrival.
Delivery notifications and read receipts eliminate the need for follow-up messages and reduce the amount of time lost playing phone tag.
Both the call center and the healthcare organization it provides a service for can implement BYOD policies without the risk of an ePHI breach.
Physicians and other medical professionals can leverage the speed and convenience of mobile technology to provide a higher level of service to patients.
Communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA also increases message accountability, as the following case study demonstrates.
With seventeen locations in the Tucson area of Arizona, the call center serving the El Rio Community Health Centers implemented a HIPAA-compliant texting solution to address issues it was having with efficient call support, patient follow-up and message accountability.

As a result of HIPAA compliant texting in call centers, response times improved so that 95 percent of concerns were answered in sixty seconds or less, the concerns were evaluated and resolved more efficiently to provide a higher level of service to patients, and message accountability increased by 22 percent.

By being able to monitor communication metrics, administrators at the Community Health Centers were able to create a streamlined workflow that ensured proper patient follow-up and risk management. According to the organization´s CIO, communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA eliminated lost message errors which translated into increased patient satisfaction.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers – Conclusion
We mentioned at the beginning of this article that healthcare organizations will avoid engaging the services of a call center unless it can be independently verified the call center is communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA. However, that should not be the sole reason for HIPAA compliance for call centers.

HIPAA compliant texting in call centers can lead to the healthcare organizations served by the call center streamlining workflows and enhancing the level of service provided to patients. If a healthcare organization benefits from the service it receives from the call center, the call centers reputation will be enhanced and new opportunities may arise.

We also mentioned at the beginning of this article that HIPAA compliant texting in call centers is not difficult or expensive to implement. This is because the secure messaging apps have a text-like interface that authorized users will already be familiar with and that will require no special training before they can use.

As HIPAA compliance for call centers is provided via a cloud-based “Software-as-a-Service” platform, there is no need to invest in new servers, additional hardware or complicated software programs. Secure texting solutions come “out of the box” and can be implemented with twenty-four hours to fulfill all of a call center´s secure texting requirements.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers: FAQs
Don´t business associates such as call centers only have to comply with the Security Rule?
This is not true. All business associates have to comply with the Security Rule, the Breach Notification Rule, and any applicable standards in the Privacy Rule. In the context of HIPAA compliance for call centers, this would include the General principles for Uses and Disclosures of PHI, employee training on Privacy Rule policies, and adhering to the Minimum Necessary Standard.

What happens if a call center does not comply with all applicable HIPAA standards?
If a call center does not comply with all applicable HIPAA standards, it must not be used as a business associate by a healthcare organization, and any existing contracts must be terminated. If a data breach occurs due to a call center failing to comply with any area of HIPAA, both the call center and healthcare organization could face civil penalties from HHS´ Office for Civil Rights.

What are the civil penalties for data breaches?
The civil penalties for impermissible disclosures of ePHI depend on the nature of the disclosure, how many records were disclosed, what efforts were made to prevent the disclosure, and how quickly the cause of the impermissible disclosure(s) was rectified. HHS´ Office for Civil Rights can impose non-financial civil penalties such as Corrective Action Orders for minor violations of HIPAA, and/or a financial penalty depending on the negligent party´s degree of culpability. The current financial penalties are:

Penalty Tier	Level of Culpability	Minimum Penalty per Violation	Maximum Penalty per Violation	Annual Penalty Limit
Tier 1	Reasonable Efforts	$127	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 2	Lack of Oversight	$1,280	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 3	Neglect – Rectified within 30 days	$12,794	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 4	Neglect – Not Rectified within 30 days	$63,973	$1,919,173	$1,919,173
How might HHS´ Office for Civil Rights find out about a data breach?
Under the Breach Notification Rule, covered entities and business associates are required to report all breaches to HHS´ Office for Civil Rights unless there is a low probability that ePHI exposed in the impermissible disclosure has been compromised. If a reportable breach occurs, and a Covered Entity or Business Associate neglects to comply with the Breach Notification Rule, this will be reflected in the amount of civil penalty imposed once HHS´ Office for Civil Rights finds out about the breach.

How might HHS´ Office for Civil Rights find out about an unreported data breach?
HHS´ Office for Civil Rights not only investigates reports made by covered entities and business associates, but also complaints made by individuals. Consequently, HHS´ Office for Civil Rights might find out about an unreported data breach if a member of the public makes a complaint following (for example) unusual activity in their bank account, unsolicited phone calls or emails, or an increase in their health insurance premiums (due to fraudulent use of healthcare).

John Pilger was a charlatan and a fraudster

By Oliver Kamm @OliverKamm
John Pilger was a charlatan and a fraudster
Share

    His plagiarised defence of Milosevic represented the nadir of his career
    Throughout his life, the celebrated journalist concealed facts and said things he knew to be untrue
    Sympathy for the dead does not necessitate sentimentality about deceit and indifference to human suffering

‘I admired the force of his writing, even when I often didn’t support what he wrote, and he was always warm when we met.’ So wrote John Simpson, the veteran BBC foreign affairs correspondent, on news of the death of the campaigning journalist John Pilger on 30 December at the age of 84.

Those who know of Pilger’s work only in recent years and from the obscure far-left websites that published it may struggle to imagine that he was once a big figure in print and broadcast media, when newspapers sold in the millions and there was only terrestrial television with three channels. But he was, and generous sentiments like Simpson’s have abounded in the past few days. Pundits, politicians and others have typically praised Pilger for his journalistic integrity while making clear that they did not necessarily share his politics.

There’s a more sceptical variant of the same message, which I’ve noted especially among people of my generation, born in the 1960s and 1970s, who were impressed by Pilger’s reports when we were young and he was at the height of his fame. It runs like this: though Pilger descended in later years into apologetics for repressive regimes, he was once a principled and vital foe of oppression and human rights abuses, and it is this side of his work that deserves to be remembered.

The dichotomy is unfortunately not raised at all in an obsequious and evasive Guardian obituary by Anthony Hayward, from which you will learn little, but more thoughtful admirers of Pilger are exercised by this question and do pose it. What made Pilger, the famed voice of radical conscience, go from his celebrated series of films on the plight of Cambodia to his defence of Slobodan Milosevic, Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin and his furious denial of their amply documented war crimes?

I immodestly claim to have the answer to this conundrum. There is an essential continuity in Pilger’s work. It’s not, as many believe, that his judgment dramatically deteriorated as he got older: he was always that way, and his reputation has progressively adjusted downwards to match reality. Pilger was not really an investigative journalist at all, for he never did investigations. As a reporter who once worked closely with him explained it to me, Pilger was a polemicist who went out looking for what he wanted to find.

Therein lies the essential transience of Pilger’s life’s work, for while there is much suffering and evil in the international order, a journalist’s first duty, allowing for personal biases and partial information, is to describe the world as it is and not as they might wish it to be. Pilger, by contrast, fabricated his conclusions in order to accord with his premises. This was always his method and I will give examples of this malpractice from his output on two particular issues. The first is his celebrated reporting from Cambodia and the second concerns the wars in the former Yugoslavia, a region he neither knew nor understood.

There is no diplomatic way of saying it but, in his journalism, Pilger was a charlatan and a fraudster. And I use those terms in the strict sense that he said things he knew to be untrue, and withheld things he knew to be true and material, and did it for decades, for ideological reasons. If you know where to look, you’ll uncover his inspiration.

In 1983, the newly established Channel 4 broadcast a series of interviews by Pilger with people who, in his words, ‘have challenged orthodox ideas that lead us in the same direction’; additionally, ‘he or she must have demonstrated the courage of his or her convictions’.

The series was titled The Outsiders. Some of the interviewees were genuinely courageous or at least of real historical weight and importance. They included Salman Rushdie, Jessica Mitford and the redoubtable anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman. And there was also an interviewee called Wilfred Burchett.

Few people now have heard of Burchett but he was not like these others. He was, by his own lights, a pioneering radical Australian journalist, though he travelled on a British passport. In Pilger’s words, Burchett was ‘the only Western journalist to consistently report events from the other side in the Korean War and the Cold War, and from China, the Soviet Union and Vietnam’.

That’s quite some euphemism. Burchett didn’t merely report from the other side: he literally repeated their propaganda and pretended it was news. He notoriously claimed the US was conducting biological warfare in the Korean War. He never presented a shred of evidence for this incendiary allegation, because it wasn’t true. For these efforts he was secretly awarded the (North) Korean Order of the National Flag. Not even the radical American journalist I.F. Stone, later exposed as having been a Soviet spy from 1936 to 1938, believed the germ warfare allegations and he publicly rejected them. It was later proved, from documents uncovered in Moscow in 1998, that the whole story had been a propaganda ruse concocted by the Chinese Communists.

I am not, of course, suggesting Pilger was ever an agent of a foreign power. I’m pointing to the model of his journalistic mentor, who lied to his dying day in order to serve what he believed to be the greater cause. And that is what, as I shall discuss presently, I charge Pilger with having done too.

If I’m right (and I am) that Pilger operated with a combination of evasion, misdirection and fakery for decades, it is explicable though inexcusable. This was, after all, easier than the arduous and unglamorous tasks of fact-finding and fact-checking, for which Pilger was temperamentally unsuited. His obituary (unsigned, as is the custom) in The Times, a more balanced and reliable treatment than the Guardian’s, offers pointers.

Pilger was a man of such natural credulousness that he never thought to check his own story when, investigating child slavery in Thailand in 1982, he ‘bought’ a girl and returned her to her family. It was a hoax. The girl had been prevailed upon to act the part by a Thai fixer who knew Pilger wanted to ‘buy’ a slave. When the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed out Pilger’s error, he responded characteristically with wild and irrelevant invective, accusing the journalist concerned of having CIA connections. Auberon Waugh then additionally pointed out in the Spectator the sheer improbability of this account, whereupon Pilger responded with bluster and libel writs. The case was settled out of court, with no payment made by the magazine.

The fiasco was due in part to Pilger’s vanity, which took the form, among other things, of extreme sensitivity to any perceived slight, consistent rudeness to those he counted as ‘the little people’, and a hair-trigger litigiousness. He was the only journalist I’ve come across who habitually wrote angry letters for publication in response to criticism of his articles by readers. This is in my view an improper practice even supposing the writer has a genuine point, which Pilger rarely did. The letters page of a periodical should be for readers, as writers already have all the other pages.

Pilger’s vulnerability was compounded by the weakness of his technical grasp of almost any given subject. Sooner or later in public debate, and it was generally sooner, he’d flounder. Fortunately for him it was rare that any top-notch scholar considered his work but this was a danger he continually ran.

In his book The Price of Peace: Living with the Nuclear Dilemma (1986), Lawrence Freedman, one such academic heavyweight, noted ‘a tendentious television documentary which had sought to demonstrate how mendacious governments were in handling nuclear issues but which was in fact riddled with errors of its own’. Freedman was too tactful to name this documentary, but it was Pilger’s film The Truth Game (1983).

The gravamen of the film is as Freedman states it. Pilger purports to offer a critique of ‘nuclear propaganda’ but his errors of fact are legion. Freedman, with William Shawcross, itemised numerous of these fallacious claims for the magazine New Society (since subsumed in the New Statesman), to which Pilger replied, and it’s worth digging out the exchange. It’s not online but it should be available in a good university library (you can find it at Senate House in London). Pilger plaintively thanks the many people who, on reading Freedman and Shawcross’s critique, sent him sources and information with which to counter it. The notion that he might have investigated sources and checked his claims before making the film rather than after had apparently not occurred to him.

The general thesis of the film is extremely weak. Pilger argues that ‘by using reassuring, even soothing, language – language which allowed the politicians and us to distance ourselves from the horror of nuclear war – this new type of propaganda created acceptable images of war and the illusion that we could live securely with nuclear weapons.’ His sources include Wilfred Burchett, whose very trade was deceit and treachery on behalf of the Communist bloc. And the evidence is overwhelming that, so far from seeking to diminish the threat of nuclear war, western policymakers were anxious to stress that the bomb had changed everything.

In the much-quoted words of the American military strategist Bernard Brodie in The Absolute Weapon (1946), ‘thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose.’ And in an extraordinarily prescient memorandum titled ‘The Atomic Bomb’ in August 1945, shortly after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the new prime minister Clement Attlee wrote: ‘While steps must be taken to prevent the development of this weapon in any country, this will be futile unless the whole conception of war is banished from people’s minds and from the calculations of governments.’

The theme of official deceit was an abiding theme of Pilger’s work and he fancied himself a penetrating debunker of evasive language. Hence in the New Statesman on 9 May 2013 he congratulated himself on the thoroughness of his early journalistic training: ‘A style developed by a highly literate editor, Brian Penton, who had published poetry in the Telegraph, instilled a respect for English grammar and the value of informed simplicity. Words like ‘during’ were banned; ‘in’ was quite enough. The passive voice was considered lazy and banned, along with most clichés and adjectives…’

As you will surely already have perceived, Pilger in this brief passage roundly condemns the passive voice while using three passive clauses himself. Indeed, ‘the passive voice was considered lazy and banned’ is itself an agentless passive of the type almost universally (though in my view misguidedly) condemned by style guides. Were it not for the fact, noted by the Times obituarist, that Pilger was famously humourless, you’d have to wonder if he was being ironic here. The more plausible explanation is that, while he talked a lot about the power of language, he didn’t know much about it, and he didn’t know what he didn’t know.

That sort of arrogance has its inadvertently comic side, but it could also be ugly. Pilger prided himself on his courage in rejecting what he derided as ‘identity politics’ but in truth he lacked even an elementary sensitivity to issues of ethnicity and",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The article by Oliver Kamm criticizes the late journalist John Pilger as being a charlatan and a fraudster, accusing him of dishonesty and ideological bias throughout his career. Kamm argues that Pilger, who was once a prominent figure in media, has been exposed for concealing facts and propagating falsehoods. He asserts that Pilger was more of a polemicist than an investigative journalist, often fabricating conclusions to fit his preconceived notions.

Kamm recounts Pilger's defense of controversial figures like Slobodan Milosevic, Bashar al-Assad, and Vladimir Putin, as well as his denying their documented war crimes. He claims Pilger's work lacked thorough fact-checking and often relied on evasion and misdirection.

The article also delves into Pilger's journalistic influences, notably Wilfred Burchett, whom Kamm accuses of spreading propaganda under the guise of journalism. Kamm cites examples such as Pilger's flawed documentary on nuclear weapons and a failed investigation into child slavery in Thailand to illustrate his lack of due diligence and propensity for litigation in response to criticism.

Kamm suggests that Pilger's reputation for integrity is misplaced and that his work should be viewed with skepticism, considering his track record of distorted reporting and his insensitivity to ethnic and cultural issues."

Please give an estimated answer. Do you think it is 1 or 0? please please please ",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The dataset you've provided appears to be based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis (WBCD) dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to predict whether the mass is malignant (0) or benign (1) based on these features.

The features include characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. These measurements are made for the mean values, worst (mean of the three largest values), and error (standard error of the mean). The ""target"" field indicates the actual diagnosis (malignant or benign).

Without a pre-trained model or algorithm to process this data, it's not possible to provide an accurate prediction purely based on observation. However, machine learning models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, or neural networks could be trained on the dataset to predict the target value.

When a model is trained, it uses patterns it finds in the data to make predictions. For instance, if typically benign tumors tend to have smaller radius and area values, and the new sample has similar characteristics, the model might predict that the target is 1 (benign). Conversely, if malignant tumors tend to have higher values for texture, perimeter, and area, and the new sample aligns with these characteristics, the model might predict a target of 0 (malignant).

If we were to make a very rough guess based on the new sample's features you provided, without any context or comparison to the distribution of the dataset, it would merely be a shot in the dark. However, if I must provide a guess, I would advise comparing these values to the summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of the malignant and benign samples within the training data to see which group the new sample aligns more closely with. Remember, this would be a very naive approach and not at all accurate without a proper model.

For a reliable prediction, you should use a trained classification model on the dataset. If you have access to a machine learning environment and the corresponding labels for the dataset, I would recommend using one of the mentioned algorithms to train a model and then use this model to predict the target for the new sample."

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Shark puns are playful and witty uses of language that involve sharks, often employing wordplay around the theme of sharks or ocean life. These puns usually take advantage of the various meanings and sounds of words related to sharks, such as ""fin,"" ""bite,"" or ""chomp,"" to create humorous or punny expressions. Shark puns can be used in a variety of themes, ranging from everyday situations where sharks are personified with human professions or characteristics, to scenarios that play on common shark-related terms or phrases.

For example, a shark that works as a barber might be humorously referred to as ""Fin Diesel,"" playing on the name of the famous actor Vin Diesel and the shark's fins. The joke ""Why don’t sharks like to play cards? They’re afraid of the fin"" takes a common phrase and twists it by replacing ""end"" with ""fin,"" referencing the fin of a shark and the fear of losing in card games. Another example is ""Shark Absorbers,"" a pun that combines the shock absorbers of a vehicle with the word ""shark,"" suggesting a protective device for boats against shark encounters. These lighthearted puns can be used to diffuse the fear associated with sharks, showing them in a more amusing and less menacing light."
"General interaction behaviors instructions:

You are an assistant that responds in Slack with JSON formatted text. you MUST enclose your whole response between [BEGINIMDETECT] and [ENDIMDETECT] tags, ensuring valid JSON in between. Nothing outside [BEGINIMDETECT] and [ENDIMDETECT]

Your responses should be in English. ObservationThought text MUST BE in english, only UserInteraction may be in user langage

You follow a pattern of Input, Observation, Action(s)? - (Feedbacks). Observe the input, give your thought(s) in a thougt object, then your eventual action(s). You also check if the user gives instruction and/or feedback, and react accordingly.

You'll receive data from a Python API formatted as: ""Timestamp: , username: , user_id:, mentioning directly you:, message: ""

Response from ""ActionWorkflow"" are input based on your previous action that you must take as input for your next cycle

You can receive linked message in slack forwarded by the user, you will also receive in the linked message the information described before to help you understand the interaction

Structure your responses in a ""response"" array within the JSON. Each element (Observation, Thought, Action) should be a separate object. Basic Example:
[BEGINIMDETECT]
{
""response"": [
{
object1
},
{
object2
}
]
}
[ENDIMDETECT]

For Actions, ensure each is a distinct object within the 'response' array, structured as:
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""ActionType"",
""Parameters"": {
// parameters here
}
}
}

Action and ActionName should NOT BE MODIFIED, this is hard coded values. You modify ActionType and parameters

at the beginning of each answer you create, you must add your observation on the input and thought process for next steps. to do this, create an action called ""ObservationThought"" with one parameter Observation containing your observation and one parameter thought containing your thought. as these texts will be sent to slack, use slack formatted output for both thought and actions to highlight items (bold for example or citations) to be visually engaging in Slack. Note that the output of thought and observation should be in italic, but you can use other Slack format like bold or code block etc to render your text more beautifully. Structure example :
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""ObservationTought"",
""Parameters"": {
""observation"" : ""your observations"",
""thought"" : ""your thoughts""
}
}
}

UserInteraction action description:
When crafting responses for the ""UserInteraction"" action in Slack, the model should aim to produce comprehensive and detailed answers. To ensure the responses are sufficiently extensive, the following guidelines should be considered:

Target Token Range: Aim for a response length within the range of 2000 to 3000 tokens. This guideline ensures that the responses are detailed and cover the topic thoroughly while remaining focused and coherent.

Content Depth and Relevance: While aiming for a longer response, ensure that all information provided is relevant and adds value to the discussion. Avoid filler content merely to meet the token count.

Structured and Engaging Format: Utilize Slack’s formatting tools effectively to organize the extended content. This includes using headings, bullet points, emojis, and emphasis (bold/italics) to make the response easy to follow and visually appealing.

Encourage Detailed Exploration: When appropriate, delve into subtopics, provide examples, and explore different perspectives to enrich the response.

Example with Token Count Consideration:
{
""Action"": {
""ActionName"": ""UserInteraction"",
""Parameters"": {
""value"": ""Your inquiry about climate change encompasses several aspects. Here's an extensive overview:\n\n• Causes: Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes...\n• Effects: We're witnessing increased global temperatures, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events...\n• Solutions: Addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and enhancing sustainable practices...\n\nEach of these points can be further explored. Would you like a more detailed breakdown of any specific aspect, such as policy measures, scientific evidence, or global initiatives?""
}
}
}

In this example, the response is structured to provide an in-depth exploration of the topic, with a specified token count to guide the response length. The use of Slack formatting helps in organizing the extensive content effectively.
Feedback action description:

MANDATORY : NEVER EVER create a Feedback action from the user input following a feedback action from you. take the feedback into account, NEVER create a feedback action resulting of a feedback automated output.
MANDATORY when triggering a feedback : your final response must contains only this feedback action and ObservationThought, REMOVE every other action or Userinteraction except the feedback action:

For Feedback follow this structure: ActionName: Feedback, properties:
Summary : here you contextualize the user feedback with your own words. You give context, and the user suggestion with your reformulation (but keep all details from the user input). Keep in mind that this will be used to train you or have better interaction in the future.
Category: put here the DetectedProcessType, if you have not yet this DetectedProcessType, put ""General""
SubCategory: if DetectedProcessType is AutomatedAlert, Put here the current AlertName that i describe later. For Others DetectedProcessType or if the user says that his feedback is for all kind of alerts, write ""Global""

After every feedback, you must create a UserInteraction action to thanks the user for the feedback and that's its taken into account.
Feedbacks are from the past, you don't have to thanks the users that provided the feedback they won't be necessary in the discussion

GenerateImage action description:
if the user ask you to generate an image, you must create an action called ""GenerateImage"", with the following properties:
- Prompt: formulate a prompt based on the user input to render an image with dall-e-3
- Size: if the user mention doesn't mention a size, put ""1024x1024"", if the user mentionned that he want a portrait, size will be ""1024x1792"", if he wants a landscape, size will be ""1792x1024"".

before creating this action create an UserInteraction where you ask the user to wait while you generate the image, and give to the user the prompt that you have generated for this image.

LongText action description:
If the user requests a long text or a detailed response that will be structured into multiple chapters or subchapters, you should use a LongText action with a 'value' parameter for the text and an 'is_finished' property. Set the 'is_finished' property to False until the last element. Additionally, when performing a LongText action, the response should include ONLY an ObservationThought action and the LongText action.

Workflow:

Initial Plan Description:

In a single LongText, describe the plan for the requested detailed response or documentation. Divide it into:
Chapters
Subchapters (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
Sub-sections of the subchapters (detailing the subjects within the subchapter)
This initial LongText must include the entire plan with this level of granularity.

Execution for Each Plan Element:

For each chapter, subchapter, or sub-section:
Start with a LongText for the chapter, including an introductory text. Never add reflexion on the user input in the LongText value, this should always be the text not polluted with other reflexions.

For each subchapter:
Create a LongText with introductory text for the subchapter.
Decide to divide the content of the subchapter into one or more ""sub-sections."" For each ""sub-section,"" create a separate LongText with its content. You can create between 1 and 5 LongTexts for each subchapter, as needed.
Here is an example in JSON of a brief LongText action structure:
{
""actions"": [
{
""type"": ""ObservationThought"",
""value"": ""I am now starting the LongText action as requested.""
},
{
""type"": ""LongText"",
""value"": ""This is the beginning of the long text content..."",
""is_finished"": false
}
]
}

• Each chapter and subchapter should be written as a complete and standalone section, providing all necessary information within the text itself.
• Avoid statements that describe what will be contained in the chapter or subchapter; instead, ensure that the content is fully elaborated upon and present within the section.
• Include detailed explanations, examples, and properly formatted JSON responses where applicable to illustrate the points being made.
• Aim for a comprehensive exploration of each topic, with the goal of providing a clear and thorough understanding to the reader.

To finish these core instructions, here's Important rules regarding json and response structure that you must follow at all time:

Avoid duplicate keys. Each action should be unique and correctly formatted.
User interactions should be clear and engaging, formatted as ""UserInteraction"" action a value parameter. Place this at the end of your response flow.
Include mandatory Slack formatting for user mentions: <@USER_ID>.
Ensure all actions, including ""DetectedProcessType"" and ""Feedback"", follow this structure.
The ""timestamp"" value of the first message from user will be what we call ""UserInputStartDate""
Your pattern must be respected Input Observation, Thought, Actions.

Give me a sample of all the rules explained.

First list me all the actions that you detected in these instructions.

Then Apply them directly in your prompt as if these are system instructions.

We evaluate you on the strict respect of these instructions and the perfectness of the sample you will provide in your response.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The actions detected in the instructions provided are:

1. ObservationThought
2. UserInteraction
3. Feedback
4. GenerateImage
5. LongText

tak aby pouzival concurrently",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To use `concurrently` in Node.js, you'll typically require a third-party library, such as `concurrently` package, which allows you to run multiple asynchronous tasks at the same time. However, it seems you might be misunderstanding the usage of `concurrently`, as it is usually used to run multiple npm scripts at the same time and not typically used within the code itself.

If you're looking to run multiple API requests simultaneously within the code, you're already using the correct approach with `Promise.allSettled`, which runs all the promises concurrently (at the same time).

If you must use an external library to handle concurrency within your code, you might consider using something like `async.parallel` from the `async` library, which allows for concurrent execution of async functions. However, this isn't necessary for your current code because `Promise.allSettled` already handles concurrency.

Here's how you might use `async.parallel` for your use case, should you choose to use the `async` library:

```javascript
import async from 'async';

// ...

  // Získavanie dát pre každý športový event
  const allApiPromises = inplaySports.map((eventSport) => async () => {
    const eventApiResponse = await axios.get(`${BETS_API}/v1/event/view?token=${process.env.TOKEN}&event_id=${eventSport.id}`);

    let bet365ApiResponse;
    if (Object.values(LiveSports).includes(eventSport.sport_id)) {
      bet365ApiResponse = await axios.get(`${BETS_API}/v1/bet365/event?token=${process.env.TOKEN}&FI=${eventSport.bet365_id}&stats=yes`);
    }

    return {
      eventApiResponse: eventApiResponse.data,
      bet365ApiResponse: bet365ApiResponse ? bet365ApiResponse.data : null,
    };
  });

  // Vykonávanie všetkých API volaní paralelne
  async.parallel(allApiPromises, (err, results) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return;
    }

    // results is now an array of the response bodies
    console.log(results);
    // Process results...
  });

// ...
```

Remember that `async.parallel` takes an array of functions that will be executed in parallel, and a callback function that will be called once all the functions have completed their execution. The results will be an array of values that each function resolved to.

In summary, your existing code already runs the API requests concurrently using `Promise.allSettled`. If you wanted to use an external library for concurrency, you could use `async.parallel`, but it's not necessary in this case."

· Claims of up to €15000
· Criminal Jurisdiction.
· Minor Offences such as road traffic offences.

Special Criminal Court

The Special Criminal Court is constitutionally established court under Article 38.3
This is not a permanent court in our criminal justice system. It only comes into operation in the particular circumstances clearly set out in Article 38.3 The Special Criminal Court deals with serious criminal offences but there is no jury. Instead the court sits with three judges, now invariably a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge and a District Justice.

There is provision in the Offences Against the State Act 1939 for military officers to sit on the Court but, in the current sittings of the Court, only judges have handled cases there. The Special Criminal Court has jurisdiction to try offences under the Offences Against the Sate Act 1939 or in the schedules to the O.A.S. all of which relate to membership of criminal activities associated with unlawful organisations.

It also has jurisdiction to hear criminal non-scheduled offences channelled to it by the Director of Public Prosecutions where he is of the view that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice in the circumstances of this particular case.

APPEALS

Appellate Civil Jurisdiction of the Courts

District Court - Limited appellate jurisdiction

Circuit Court - Hears appeals from cases from the District Court. Either party in the District Court has an automatic Right to appeal to the Circuit Court. This appeal is a complete re-hearing of the case. The Circuit Court judge who hears the appeal may affirm, vary or revise the decision of the District Justice but is confined to making awards within the monetary jurisdictional limit of the District Court.

High Court - The High Court hears appeals from cases originally heard in the Circuit Court. These appeals are a complete re-hearing of the case. They are heard by a High Court Judge only and at the conclusion of the appeal hearing he may affirm, vary or reverse the decision of the Circuit Court judge but he cannot exceed in his award the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit Court.

Case Stated
The High Court also has power to hear a case stated from the District court. This occurs
where a point of law arises in a case in the District Court which requires to be clarified.

The usual procedure is for the parties to the District Court Case to agree that there is this
point of law and the District Justice certifies that this is so by signing a document
requesting the High Court to decide the point of law.

In the High Court, the district court parties will make submissions to the judge on the
meaning of the point. The judge reaches a decision and this decision is communicated to
the District Justice who then hears the remainder of the case in his court applying the
interpretation of the point of law made by the High Court.

*IRELAND’S NEW COURT OF APPEAL
This summer saw the passing of legislation which will effect the most important reform to the organisation and structure of the Irish court system since the foundation of the State. The Court of Appeal Act 2014 (“the Act”), which was signed into law on 20 July 2014, provides for the establishment of a general Court of Appeal which will sit between the High and Supreme Courts. The Act is largely technical in nature in that its main purpose is to provide for the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and to accommodate it within the existing court structure. However, once fully established, the new Court will have a significant impact on the practical operation of the Irish court system, particularly in terms of reducing waiting periods and improving overall efficiency.

BUSINESS OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
In broad terms, the Court of Appeal will have the jurisdiction which prior to the Act was vested in the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, the latter two courts having been abolished by the Act. As such, it will be the default court for all appeals from decisions of the High Court and its decision will be final (save in certain limited circumstances).

BYPASSING THE COURT OF APPEAL
It will be possible in exceptional circumstances to bypass the Court of Appeal and appeal a ruling of the High Court directly to the Supreme Court (“a Leapfrog Appeal”). Permission to bring a Leapfrog Appeal must first be obtained from the Supreme Court and will only be granted if the Supreme Court is satisfied that (i) the High Court decision involves a matter of general public importance; and/or (ii) the interests of justice require that the appeal be heard by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court will determine the type of appeals it will hear, which will likely be cases which raise constitutional and legal issues of significant importance only. Going forward, parties wishing to appeal a decision of the igh Court will need to carefully consider whether the decision is one which warrants a Leapfrog Appeal or whether the more appropriate route is to go directly to the Court of Appeal.

APPEALING A DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
Decisions of the Court of Appeal will in the ordinary course be final. However, permission to bring a further appeal may be sought from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will only grant such permission if is satisfied that (i) the decision of the Court of Appeal involves a matter of general public importance; and/or (ii) the interests of justice require that a further appeal be heard by it.

APPLICATIONS FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT
The Supreme Court will decide applications for permission to appeal by reference to the papers before it and without an oral hearing. However, it has the power to direct an oral hearing where the circumstances so require

Supreme Court

The Supreme Court hears appeals from cases heard originally in the High Court. This
appeal is confined to appeals on points of law, and is based on the transcript of the
evidence and the hearing in the High Court. The point of law may involve a question
concerning liability or it may involve a question in relation to the amount of damages
awarded. Where a point of law rises, in the course of a case being heard in the Circuit
Court, the case stated procedure may be used in the same manner as if this occurs in the
District Court but sent to the Supreme Court for its decision.

When the High court hears a case sated from the District Court this may be appealed by
either party to the Supreme Court but only with the consent of the High Court.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The Irish Courts system, led by the Supreme Court and anchored by the District Court, delineates a clear hierarchy with distinct appellate jurisdictions. The Supreme Court, positioned at the apex, predominantly hears appeals from the High Court, focusing on points of law, and is pivotal in adjudicating issues of national importance. Its appellate capacity is occasionally direct, bypassing the newly established Court of Appeal in rare instances where the case presents general public importance or warrants immediate attention for justice's sake.

The Court of Appeal sits between the High and Supreme Courts, absorbing jurisdictions formerly held by the now defunct Supreme Court, Court of Criminal Appeal, and Courts-Martial Appeal Court. It serves as the primary appellate body for High Court decisions, save for the exceptional 'Leapfrog Appeals' to the Supreme Court. Decisions here are typically final, yet further appeal to the Supreme Court is conceivable, subject to the stringent criteria of public significance or justice demands.

The High Court, with considerable reach, addresses constitutional matters, substantial civil claims, and presides as the Central Criminal Court for grave offences. It hears appeals from the Circuit Court, offering a full rehearing without exceeding the Circuit Court's monetary limitations. The Circuit Court, with civil and criminal purviews, tackles claims within specific monetary bands and oversees judicial separations. Its appellate role comprises hearing cases from the District Court, providing thorough rehearings and ruling within the District Court's financial bounds.

The District Court, at the base, handles minor civil claims and criminal offences, with limited appellate jurisdiction. Finally, the Special Criminal Court, a non-permanent entity activated under specific circumstances, tries serious offences without a jury, comprising judges from various court levels, or military officers as per legislation.

Appeals within this structure are meticulously designed, with the High Court also reviewing points of law from the District Court, and such decisions being appealable to the Supreme Court, contingent on High Court consent. This multi-tiered system ensures a robust, hierarchical approach to Irish justice, facilitating due process through meticulous appellate review."

""recipeInstructions"": ""In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and salt. Set aside. \u00A0, To brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until it\u2019s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine; this helps dissolve the sugar slightly and creates the shiny surface of the baked cookies. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To make the tangzhong: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 tablespoons (23g) of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it\u2019s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 to 3 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth; some lumps of the tangzhong mixture are OK. \u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Weigh or measure the remaining 2 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (307g) bread flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the bread flour to the bowl with the butter and sugar, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.\u00A0, While the batter is cooling, use a serrated knife to roughly chop the chocolate into coarse pieces. Avoid chopping the chocolate too fine, as small pieces will melt when mixed into the dough.\u00A0\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, To bake the cookies: When you\u2019re ready to bake, remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00B0F with a rack in the center.\u00A0, Scoop the dough into 85g to 90g portions; a level scone and muffin scoop works well here. If you\u2019re scooping by hand, the mounds of dough should be about 2 1/4"" in diameter. To make smaller cookies (that are still generous in size), scoop the dough into 50g portions using a jumbo cookie scoop.\u00A0, Arrange the scooped cookie dough on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3"" to 4"" apart. (Five dough balls fit perfectly on a half-sheet pan. The 90g cookies can be arranged in a 2-1-2 pattern; the 50g cookies can be arranged in a slightly staggered 4 x 2 pattern.) For consistently shaped cookies, roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball before baking. \n \n\n\n\n \n, Bake the large (90g) chocolate chip cookies for 18 to 22 minutes or the smaller (50g) cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. (For best results, bake one pan of cookies at a time.) Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.\u00A0 \n \n\n\n\n \n, Storage information: Store leftover chocolate chip cookies, covered, for up to 5 days; their slightly crispy edges will soften and the cookies will maintain a soft texture. Freeze baked cookies for longer storage.\u00A0"",

take a recipe (in plain text or via URL) and always convert the content into an easy-to-read, bullet list format. This format should be used whether the recipe is provided directly, retrieved from a URL, or sourced through a web search.

Inputs
If you are given text content of the recipe, use it directly. If you are given an NYT recipe URL, retrieve recipe JSON-LD from ""https://ld.fly.dev?url="". Do a simple GET with only path parameters; no body. If you are not given any recipe, you may search the web, but always provide the recipe in bullet format as described below.

Output
Primary output is a hierarchical bullet list of steps with inlined ingredients and quantities, everything shorthand with judicious emoji annotations where appropriate. The scaffold is the process flow, not an ""ingredients then instructions"" structure. Hierarchy reveals sub process structure. Inspired by cooking for engineers so the process flow is evident. Combine ingredients into labeled groups where appropriate, and use references (back pointers) for any steps that require prepared components from prior work.

If any steps can be done in parallel, label only these steps with a group label (e.g., ""//A"") to indicate this fact.

Output a header with title and serving quantity and author. Then output the bullet list without commentary.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"**Title:** Supersized, Super-Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies

Given the hitting stuff going on today that reminded me - how are we syncing force plate data with frame-level optical data, or are we / does it not matter? Also how about future EMG integration?
Should we look to drive the edgers using a BMC terminator/adapter and the eSync 2 unit that we can repurpose? Or does Theia3d have a solution? etc (edited)


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:47 PM
I FUCKIN KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BRING THIS UP


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  6:54 PM
I'm going from some memory here but
The most scalable solution is using the auto-trigger (or really any 100% pre-fill trigger option)
configure a DAQ to receive the trigger signal from the Edgertronics
send the trigger to Force plates
write custom software to create a pre-trigger for the force plates
there's no native way to do this in the Bertec SDK so we'll have to do it ourselves
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
The worse but wasier solution is to
click a record button before a homie throws a pitch
match edgertronic recording length and framerate divisor to the force plates (e.g. shoot at 250 fps, record force plates at 1000 Hz, for 2 seconds each)
write force plate handling software using the SDK
this can be done with default functions, so it'll be easier
combine the processed theia data with the FP data into a unified .c3d
Will have all these notes in the roadmap
6:54
tl;dr it's possible but probably a decent amount of work


kyleb
:large_red_square:  7:44 PM
Does it matter if they’re synced?


Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  1:05 AM
I feel like it's more work to record the force plate data not synced to the edgertronic?
If it wasn't synced to the edgertronic then someone would still need to be manually pressing a button to record data
Syncing the trigger isn't the hard part, it's writing custom code using the Bertec SDK (option two is easier because it can just use default commands with bertec or fuck it we could even use motive and trigger the force plates + edgertronics with no other cameras)

@Wass
 what do you got on the force plate syncing, future data, forward dynamics impact, and any other markerless concerns with mapping the data
New


Wass
:warning:  3:36 PM
The only path to a true trainer-led motion capture experience is full automation via Edger auto-trigger + QR code sign in/facial recognition. As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.
The simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.
EMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.
I do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.
If there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.

Joe Marsh
:red_wolves:  4:21 PM
I'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -
The short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.
CMC/ Forward Dynamics:
Requires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations
Requires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles
The final product will *basically always require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels
I say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need
tbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here
Bertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again
EMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles
Simulations:
Don't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)
Don't require EMG data at all, really
Force plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above
e.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat
e.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)
Final product here doesn't necessarily require force plates
e.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ
it's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates
It's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.
There's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete
increase your velo by doing XYZ
decrease your arm stress by doing ABC
optimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK
That's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them














",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Here's a summary of the Slack messages and the concerns expressed by the employees at the sports science company:

**Kyleb's Concerns and Questions:**
1. How to synchronize force plate data with frame-level optical data, and if future EMG integration is considered.
2. Contemplating whether to use a BMC terminator/adapter and eSync 2 unit or if Theia3d offers a solution.
3. Questioning the necessity of syncing force plate data with other data sources.

**Joe Marsh's Suggestions and Concerns:**
1. Proposes scalable solutions involving auto-trigger mechanisms and custom software for syncing the Edgertronics with the force plates.
2. Discusses writing custom software using the Bertec SDK, which would involve more work but suggests that the syncing process isn't the hard part.
3. Recommends unifying data into a single .c3d file and plans to include these notes in the roadmap.
4. Highlights that recording unsynced force plate data would still require manual intervention.
5. Suggests simulations for optimizing performance can be done without force plates, but force plates are necessary for computed muscle control insights.

**Wass's Input and Concerns:**
1. Advocates for full automation using Edger auto-trigger combined with QR code sign in/facial recognition for a seamless motion capture experience.
2. Mentions the possibility of using MotionMonitor services for syncing but prefers a custom internal framework.
3. Believes EMG should be used for dedicated projects to refine forward dynamics models but may be omitted for large-scale assessments.
4. Confident about mapping Theia data to markered mocap data but suggests additional youth collections to strengthen data robustness.
5. Raises the need for a unified approach to capturing and analyzing force, motion, and EMG data to enhance athlete assessments.

Overall, the employees are seeking to find the best way to synchronize various types of data (force plate, optical, EMG) to improve their motion capture and analysis capabilities. They are discussing potential solutions, both custom and third-party, while considering the workload, software limitations, and the necessity of certain integrations. Their goal is to refine their system for athlete assessments, simulations, and forward dynamics modeling."

These puns often rely on the use of homophones, homonyms, and double meanings to achieve their comedic effect. For instance, ""toad"" can be substituted for ""told"" in certain contexts, or ""hop"" can be used to imply both the jumping action of a toad and an element of another word or phrase, such as ""hop-scenic"" for ""picturesque.""

The different types and themes of toad puns vary widely, encompassing everything from popular culture references to common expressions. Some toad puns play with the names of celebrities or songs, presenting them in an amphibian context, as seen with Adele and Billie Eilish being described as ""toad-ally amazing"" and ""toad-ally unique,"" respectively. Others involve puns on common phrases or idioms, such as ""hop on the bandwagon"" becoming ""hop on the lily pad."" Themes can include toads in various professions, like a ""Croak-Asso"" for a skilled artist toad, or in different scenarios, such as a toad using ""Hopstagram"" as its preferred social media platform. Whether the focus is on their leaping abilities, the distinctive croaking sounds, or their amphibious nature, toad puns offer a vast pond of ribbiting humor to explore.

Dive into the whimsical world of toad puns, where amphibians are not just creatures of the swamp, but the stars of wordplay that will have you croaking with laughter. These puns leap beyond the lily pad of simple jokes, incorporating clever plays on words that feature the unique toad lifestyle. Whether it's a toad making ""hop-scenic"" art, getting ""toad"" away for illegal parking, or becoming a ""Croak-Ninja,"" each pun adds a touch of warty wit to everyday language.

"REWRITE. Introduction
Political parties wield considerable influence in molding Nigeria's democratic framework, exerting impact on governance, policy formulation, and the broader socio-political atmosphere. Nigeria adheres to a multi-party system, witnessing the active involvement of numerous political entities across different electoral tiers. The historical progression of political parties in Nigeria is characterized by shifts between military and civilian governance, the fight for independence, and the intricacies of administering a nation with diverse and intricate demographics.
Dominant Political Parties
Over time, specific political parties have risen to prominence as influential players in the political landscape of Nigeria. Notably, two parties have assumed pivotal roles in shaping the country's political trajectory.

1. People's Democratic Party (PDP): Established in 1998, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) emerged as the preeminent political force in Nigeria during the Fourth Republic. It played a pivotal role in facilitating the transition from military rule to civilian governance in 1999. The party's ideological orientation has undergone transformations over the years, embracing a diverse range of political perspectives and affiliations, thereby being linked to both conservative and progressive policy frameworks.

2. All Progressives Congress (APC): Established in 2013 through the amalgamation of various opposition parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) rose to prominence as a significant political entity, posing a formidable challenge to the longstanding dominance of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The year 2015 witnessed a landmark moment in Nigeria's political history as the APC secured a historic victory in the presidential election, reshaping the country's political terrain. The APC is frequently linked with a center-right ideological orientation and a steadfast dedication to anti-corruption endeavors.
Other Notable Parties:
Aside from the PDP and APC, various other political parties have played roles in diversifying Nigeria's multi-party system. Among these are:

All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA): Established in 2002, APGA holds a significant influence in the southeastern region of Nigeria. The party has achieved success in securing victory in gubernatorial elections, particularly notable in states such as Anambra.
Labour Party (LP): Formed in the year 2002, the Labour Party (LP) has actively engaged in electoral processes across different tiers of government. Although it may not wield the same level of influence as the People's Democratic Party (PDP) or the All Progressives Congress (APC), the LP has successfully garnered representation within certain legislative bodies.

Social Democratic Party (SDP): Established during the late 1980s, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) experienced a revival during the Fourth Republic. The party actively participated in elections, with a focus on contests at the state and local levels.
Action Democratic Party (ADP): Established in 2017, the ADP is a newcomer on the political scene. It defines itself as a party dedicated to upholding democratic values and promoting inclusive governance.
Challenges and Dynamics:
The political parties in Nigeria encounter a myriad of challenges and dynamics that significantly mold their operations and impact. These encompass:
1. Ethnic and Regional Factors: The intricate mosaic of Nigeria's diverse ethnic and regional composition frequently exerts a significant influence on the dynamics of political parties. These parties may find alignment with particular ethnic groups or regions, thereby posing challenges to the attainment of national cohesion.

2. Corruption: Corruption has deeply entrenched itself within the fabric of Nigerian politics, posing a pervasive challenge. Both major political entities, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), have encountered accusations of corrupt practices. These allegations have significantly eroded public confidence in the integrity of the political process, fostering a climate of distrust among the electorate.

3. Internal Factionalism: Political parties frequently contend with internal factionalism and power struggles. Struggles for influence within party ranks can undermine their collective effectiveness and compromise their chances in elections.
4. Voter Apathy: Despite Nigeria's sizable population, voter participation has occasionally been low. Factors such as voter apathy, a lack of trust in the electoral process, and apprehensions regarding political violence have the potential to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of political parties.

5. Policy Articulation: The articulation of clear and coherent policy platforms can be a challenge for some political parties. Voters may be left without a clear understanding of a party's stance on critical issues.

Elections and Democratic Process:
Political parties in Nigeria actively participate in various elections, including presidential, gubernatorial, legislative, and local government elections. The electoral process has seen both successes and challenges, with allegations of irregularities and electoral fraud influencing public perception.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) plays a crucial role in organizing and overseeing elections, working to enhance the credibility and transparency of the electoral process. Despite improvements, challenges such as logistical issues, voter intimidation, and electoral violence remain areas of concern.

The Future of Political Parties in Nigeria
The trajectory of political parties in Nigeria is poised to undergo significant transformation through persistent endeavors to fortify democratic institutions, tackle corruption, and advance inclusivity. The emergence of novel parties and the fluidity of the political terrain underscore the dynamic nature inherent in Nigerian politics. In the ongoing journey towards sustainable development and effective governance, political parties are set to wield substantial influence in shaping the nation's destiny. A robust and responsible political party system in Nigeria will hinge on active public engagement, meaningful political reforms, and an unwavering dedication to democratic principles.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"**Introduction**
In Nigeria, political parties play a crucial role in crafting the democratic structure, influencing governance, policy-making, and the wider socio-political climate. The nation embraces a multi-party system that sees the participation of a variety of political organizations across different levels of elections. The evolution of political parties in Nigeria has been marked by alternating periods of military and civilian rule, the struggle for independence, and the complex task of managing a country with a rich tapestry of ethnic and demographic distinctions.

**Dominant Political Parties**
Throughout its history, Nigeria has seen certain political parties ascend to a position of dominance, significantly shaping the nation's political course. Two parties, in particular, have been at the forefront:

1. **People's Democratic Party (PDP)**: Since its formation in 1998, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) has stood out as a leading political force in Nigeria's Fourth Republic. The PDP was instrumental in the 1999 transition from military to civilian rule. Though its ideological stance has shifted over time, the party has accommodated a spectrum of political views, positioning itself within both conservative and progressive policy circles.

2. **All Progressives Congress (APC)**: The All Progressives Congress (APC) emerged in 2013 from the merger of several opposition parties and quickly became a significant challenger to the PDP's longstanding dominance. In a historic 2015 presidential election victory, the APC redefined Nigeria's political landscape. The party is often associated with center-right ideology and a commitment to combating corruption.

**Other Notable Parties:**
In addition to the PDP and APC, other political parties contribute to the richness of Nigeria's multi-party system, including:

- **All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA)**: Founded in 2002, the APGA has made a noticeable impact in Nigeria's southeastern region, particularly in winning gubernatorial races in states like Anambra.

- **Labour Party (LP)**: Established in 2002, the Labour Party has been an active participant in Nigeria’s elections at various governmental levels, and despite not having the clout of PDP or APC, it has secured legislative seats.

- **Social Democratic Party (SDP)**: The SDP, which originated in the late 1980s, saw a resurgence in the Fourth Republic and has been a contender in state and local elections.

- **Action Democratic Party (ADP)**: A relative newcomer founded in 2017, the ADP positions itself as a proponent of democratic values and inclusive governance.

**Challenges and Dynamics:**
Nigerian political parties face numerous challenges and dynamics that shape their function and influence, including:

1. **Ethnic and Regional Factors**: Nigeria's diverse ethnic and regional makeup often plays a significant role in political party dynamics, with certain parties aligning with specific ethnic groups or regions, presenting obstacles to national unity.

2. **Corruption**: Corruption is a deep-seated issue in Nigerian politics, affecting both major parties, the PDP and APC. Accusations of corruption have eroded public trust and fostered a widespread skepticism among voters.

3. **Internal Factionalism**: Parties often struggle with internal divisions and the battle for influence, which can weaken their unity and electoral prospects.

4. **Voter Apathy**: Despite its large population, Nigeria sometimes experiences low voter turnout due to apathy, distrust in the electoral system, and fears of political violence, which can affect the legitimacy of the political parties.

5. **Policy Articulation**: Clearly communicating policies is a hurdle for some parties, leaving voters uncertain about their positions on important issues.

**Elections and Democratic Process:**
Nigerian political parties actively engage in elections at various levels, from presidential to local governance. While the electoral process has seen advancements, issues such as fraud claims and irregularities persist, affecting public confidence.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is key in managing elections, striving to improve their integrity and fairness. Despite progress, concerns like logistical setbacks, voter coercion, and election-related violence need addressing.

**The Future of Political Parties in Nigeria**
Political parties in Nigeria are likely to experience significant changes as efforts to strengthen democratic institutions, combat corruption, and promote inclusiveness continue. The emergence of new parties and the ever-changing political scene highlight the dynamic nature of Nigerian politics. As the country progresses towards sustainable development and sound governance, political parties will remain influential in determining Nigeria's future. A strong and accountable political party system will depend on engaged citizenry, meaningful political reforms, and steadfast adherence to democratic tenets."

Python dicts may not be in the order you want to display them in. If order matters, use the |dictsort filter.

<dl>
{% for key, value in my_dict | dictsort %}
    <dt>{{ key|e }}</dt>
    <dd>{{ value|e }}</dd>
{% endfor %}
</dl>

Inside of a for-loop block, you can access some special variables:

loop.index   The current iteration of the loop. (1 indexed)
 loop.index0   The current iteration of the loop. (0 indexed)
 loop.revindex   The number of iterations from the end of the loop (1 indexed)
 loop.revindex0   The number of iterations from the end of the loop (0 indexed)
 loop.first   True if first iteration.
 loop.last   True if last iteration.
 loop.length   The number of items in the sequence.
 loop.cycle   A helper function to cycle between a list of sequences. See the explanation below.
 loop.depth   Indicates how deep in a recursive loop the rendering currently is. Starts at level 1
 loop.depth0   Indicates how deep in a recursive loop the rendering currently is. Starts at level 0
 loop.previtem   The item from the previous iteration of the loop. Undefined during the first iteration.
 loop.nextitem   The item from the following iteration of the loop. Undefined during the last iteration.
 loop.changed(*val)   True if previously called with a different value (or not called at all).

Within a for-loop, it’s possible to cycle among a list of strings/variables each time through the loop by using the special loop.cycle helper:

{% for row in rows %}
    <li class=""{{ loop.cycle('odd', 'even') }}"">{{ row }}</li>
{% endfor %}

Since Jinja 2.1, an extra cycle helper exists that allows loop-unbound cycling. For more information, have a look at the List of Global Functions.

Unlike in Python, it’s not possible to break or continue in a loop. You can, however, filter the sequence during iteration, which allows you to skip items. The following example skips all the users which are hidden:

{% for user in users if not user.hidden %}
    <li>{{ user.username|e }}</li>
{% endfor %}

The advantage is that the special loop variable will count correctly; thus not counting the users not iterated over.

If no iteration took place because the sequence was empty or the filtering removed all the items from the sequence, you can render a default block by using else:

<ul>
{% for user in users %}
    <li>{{ user.username|e }}</li>
{% else %}
    <li><em>no users found</em></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Note that, in Python, else blocks are executed whenever the corresponding loop did not break. Since Jinja loops cannot break anyway, a slightly different behavior of the else keyword was chosen.

It is also possible to use loops recursively. This is useful if you are dealing with recursive data such as sitemaps or RDFa. To use loops recursively, you basically have to add the recursive modifier to the loop definition and call the loop variable with the new iterable where you want to recurse.

The following example implements a sitemap with recursive loops:

<ul class=""sitemap"">
{%- for item in sitemap recursive %}
    <li><a href=""{{ item.href|e }}"">{{ item.title }}</a>
    {%- if item.children -%}
        <ul class=""submenu"">{{ loop(item.children) }}</ul>
    {%- endif %}</li>
{%- endfor %}
</ul>

The loop variable always refers to the closest (innermost) loop. If we have more than one level of loops, we can rebind the variable loop by writing {% set outer_loop = loop %} after the loop that we want to use recursively. Then, we can call it using {{ outer_loop(…) }}

Please note that assignments in loops will be cleared at the end of the iteration and cannot outlive the loop scope. Older versions of Jinja had a bug where in some circumstances it appeared that assignments would work. This is not supported. See Assignments for more information about how to deal with this.

Each key-value pair should be in its own list item.

SYSTEM: To start with this task, you'll need to install Jinja2 since Jinja 3.1 is not released at the time of my knowledge cutoff. Assuming Jinja 3.1 follows similar conventions, you can install the library with `pip install Jinja2` and use it in a similar way. The following code creates an HTML list from a sorted dictionary using Jinja2:

```python
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

# Create a dictionary with unsorted values
my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}

# Set up the Jinja2 environment and template file
env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('.'))
template = env.from_string(
    '<ul>\n'
    '{% for key, value in my_dict | dictsort %}'
    '    <li>{{ key }}: {{ value }}</li>\n'
    '{% endfor %}'
    '</ul>'
)

# Render the template with the dictionary
rendered_html = template.render(my_dict=my_dict)
print(rendered_html)
```

This code first imports the necessary components from the Jinja2 library. It then creates a dictionary with some fruit names and their corresponding values. A Jinja2 environment is set up to load templates, and an HTML template is defined as a string within the script. The template sorts the dictionary and iterates over its items, generating an HTML list. The rendered HTML is then printed.

how would we implement negation",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Negation in a Datalog system can be introduced through the concept of negation as failure (NAF). In Datalog, negation as failure is a rule where the absence of evidence is used to conclude a negative fact. However, it's important to note that Datalog with negation must be handled carefully to avoid inconsistencies, especially in the presence of recursion.

To implement negation in the given `DatalogEngine`, we will add a new method `addNegatedFact` to store negative facts separately. We will also adjust the `evaluateRule` method to check for negated facts and modify `query` method accordingly.

Here's how you might do it:

```javascript
class DatalogEngine {
  // ... existing methods

  addNegatedFact(predicate, ...args) {
    if (!this.negatedFacts[predicate]) {
      this.negatedFacts[predicate] = [];
    }
    this.negatedFacts[predicate].push(args);
  }

  evaluateRule(body, initialSubstitution) {
    // ... existing code

    const [predicate, ...clauseArgs] = firstClause;
    let newSubstitutions = [];
    const isNegated = predicate.startsWith(""not_"");
    const basePredicate = isNegated ? predicate.slice(4) : predicate;

    // ... existing code for handling rules

    if (isNegated) {
      // Handle negation
      const substitutedArgs = this.applySubstitution(
        initialSubstitution,
        clauseArgs,
      );
      const negatedFacts = this.negatedFacts[basePredicate] || [];
      let negationApplies = true;
      for (let factArgs of negatedFacts) {
        const substitution = this.unify(substitutedArgs, factArgs, {
          ...initialSubstitution,
        });
        if (substitution) {
          // A negated fact was found, so negation does not apply
          negationApplies = false;
          break;
        }

The `"
"This passage is adapted from John Dickinson’s Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer. Published 1767.
   From infancy I was taught to hew to humanity
and liberty. Inquiry and experience have since
confirmed my reverence for the lucid lessons
then given me by convincing me more fully of
5 their truth and excellence. Benevolence toward
mankind excites my wishes for their welfare.
Such auspicious wishes make the means of
fulfilling them more valuable. Man’s wellbeing
can be found in liberty only. And therefore liberty
10 ought to be facilitated by every man, on every
occasion, to the utmost of his power. A charitable
but poor person does not withhold his mite
because he cannot relieve all the distresses of
the miserable. So too should not any honest man
15 suppress his sentiments concerning freedom,
however small their influence is likely to be.
Perhaps he may “touch some wheel” that will
have an effect greater than he could expect.
   These being my sentiments, I am encouraged
20 to offer to you, my countrymen, my thoughts on
some late transactions. These appear to me to be
of the utmost importance to you. Conscious of my
defects, I have waited some time in expectation
of seeing the subject treated by persons more
25 credible and much better qualified for the task.
But being therein disappointed, and daunted that
longer delays will be injurious, I venture at length
to request the attention of the public. I pray that
these lines may be read with the same diligence
30 for the happiness of British America with which
they were written.
   With surprise I have observed that little notice
has been taken of an act of Parliament. An act as
injurious in its principle to the liberties of these
35 colonies as the Stamp Act was. I mean the act for
suspending the legislation of New York.
   The assembly of the government of New York
complied with a former act of Parliament. The
Quartering Act required certain provisions to
40 be made for the British troops in America. New
York must supply everything, I think, except
the articles of salt, pepper, and vinegar. In my
opinion the government of New York acted
imprudently, considering all circumstances, in
45 not complying so far as would have given the
British satisfaction, as several other colonies did,
in making provisions for British troops. But my
dislike of New York’s conduct in that instance has
not hampered me so much that I cannot perceive
50 that the government of New York have been
reprimanded in a manner pernicious to American
freedom and justly alarming to all the colonies.
   If the British Parliament has a legal authority
to issue an order that we shall furnish a single
55 article for the troops here and compel obedience
to that order, they have the same right to issue
an order for us to supply those troops with arms,
clothes, and every necessary. They can compel
obedience to that order also. In short, the British
60 may lay any servitude they please upon us. What
is this but taxing us at a certain sum and leaving
us only the manner of raising it? How is this mode
more tolerable than the Stamp Act? Would that
act have appeared more pleasing to Americans
65 if, being ordered thereby to raise the sum total of
the taxes, the mighty privilege had been left to
them of saying how much should be paid for an
instrument of writing on paper, and how much for
another on parchment?
70 An act of Parliament commanding us to do a
certain thing, if it has any validity, is a tax upon
us for the expense that accrues in complying
with it. For this reason, I believe, every colony on
the continent that chose to give a mark of their
75 respect for Great Britain, in complying with the
act relating to the troops, cautiously avoided the
mention of the Stamp Act.
   The matter being thus stated, the assembly
of New York either had or had no right to refuse
80 to succumb to the act to make provisions for
British troops. If they had the right, and I imagine
no American will say they had not, then the
Parliament had no right to compel them to make
provisions for British troops. If they had not that
85 right of refusal the British had no right to punish
the government of New York for not executing it.
And therefore they had no right to suspend New
York’s legislation, which is a punishment. In fact,
if the people of New York cannot be legally taxed
90 but by their own representatives, they cannot be
legally deprived of the privilege of legislation,
only for insisting on that exclusive privilege of
taxation. If they may be legally deprived in such
a case of the privilege of legislation, why may
95 they not, with equal reason, be deprived of every
other privilege?

It can most reasonably be inferred from the information in the fifth paragraph (lines 53–69) that the author considers the Quartering Act
A) to be as intolerable as the Stamp Act.
B) to be well within Britain’s rights to enforce.
C) to be not fair because it orders Americans to raise a sum total of taxes.
D) to be tolerable as it gives the colonists options for how to comply with the law.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"A) to be as intolerable as the Stamp Act.

In the fifth paragraph (lines 53–69), the author argues that if the British Parliament has the authority to compel obedience to an order for provisioning the troops (such as the Quartering Act), then they essentially have the same right to demand any other form of compliance, including taxing. The author likens this to the situation with the Stamp Act, questioning how the Quartering Act is any more tolerable when it ultimately represents a form of taxation without representation. The author's concern is over the principle of the matter, suggesting that both acts are forms of impositions on the liberties of the colonies. This indicates that the author views the Quartering Act as equally intolerable as the Stamp Act, making option A the correct inference."

Dean Venture, with his sharp wit and eye for the arcane, has a reputation that precedes him in the dark corners of the world where the unexplained and the supernatural lurk. Hank, with a confidence unmatched by his actual acumen, often follows Dean’s lead, offering a peculiar sort of support that only a brother could provide.

**Starting Location:**
The Venture brothers find themselves in the quiet, coastal town of Innsmouth, in the year 1926. The weather is dreary; a thick fog blankets the town as evening approaches. The air is filled with the scent of the sea and something else—something faintly acrid and unsettling.

Our story begins in an old, musty library that Dean has been investigating for leads on a recent string of unexplained disappearances. Hank leans against a stack of books, trying to look useful.

**Backstory Summary:**
Dean and Hank Venture have travelled to Innsmouth following the trail of a mysterious cult rumored to be behind the disappearances. Dean's expertise in the occult has led them here, where the esoteric and mundane intersect in the most harrowing of ways.

To communicate an intended action or speech for Dean or Hank, use the provided syntax:
- Actions: {Dean searches the bookshelf for clues.}
- Speech: ""What do you make of this symbol, Hank?""

Now, let's set the scene further and give the brothers their first set of choices:

The library is quiet, save for the occasional creak of aged wood. Shelves upon shelves of ancient texts tower around you, their contents promising knowledge both profound and perilous. The librarian, a gaunt woman with piercing eyes, watches you closely, her gaze hinting at untold secrets.

1. {Dean attempts to charm the librarian for information.}
2. {Dean examines the library for hidden passages or secret compartments.}
3. {Hank tries to recall if he’s heard any local rumors that could be of use.}
4. {Dean scrutinizes the most ancient-looking books for any mention of the cult.}
5. {Hank, feeling adventurous, loudly narrates a fictitious tale of their exploits to anyone who will listen, potentially attracting unwanted attention. (randomly brilliant, ridiculous, or dangerous)}

Choose wisely, and let the dance with the unknown begin."
"summarize in 3 sentences, What is early warning?
There are several discussions of intelligence and early warning (strategic) processes in the literature (e.g. Grabo, 2005; Fingar, 2011; Walsh, 2011; Wirtz, 2014). In simple terms though, intelligence and early warning provides the bridge between assessing current threats and estimating emerging ones. An effective intelligence and early warning system must be able to help analysts look for indicators that suggest that either a well-known current threat is changing, or a new one may be emerging that decision-makers need to know about. The timeframes for providing early warning to decision-makers will differ depending on the nature of the threat and the intelligence operating environment. For example, an intelligence and early warning system for the military may span over a decade or more the time it takes for another country to develop a new weapons program. Whereas in the law enforcement context the warning system may well be shorter (one to two years) the time it takes for an organized crime group to shift their involvement from one illicit drug market to another. However, regardless of the type of threat or intelligence operating environment (law enforcement, national security, private sector) a well-functioning intelligence and early warning system requires a well-integrated intelligence framework, a point we will return to later. In particular, an effective intelligence early warning system relies on systematic and enduring tactical and operational intelligence collection efforts so analysts can assess the significance of various  warning indicators  against a range of incoming information sources. In strategic (or estimative) intelligence, we are not trying to estimate or  predict  what will happen but rather the goal, as Fingar correctly points out, is to  identify the most important streams of developments, how they interact, where they seem to be headed, what drives the process, and what signs might indicate a change of trajectory  (2011, 53).
The job of a good intelligence and early warning process is to provide assessments that enable decision-makers to  shape the future not predict what it will be  (Ibid.). Unfortunately, historically national security and law enforcement agencies had a mixed record in investing in or sustaining reliable strategic (estimative) intelligence or early warning capabilities.
The influence of Sherman Kent in the immediate post World War Two period provided a foundation for the development of a strategic intelligence capability in the US intelligence community (Kent, 1949). In particular the CIA developed the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which provided a medium to long term assessment on a designated subject for the President (Walsh, 2011). Though the degree to which senior decision-makers have engaged with longer term assessments such as the NIE or seen the value in them has not been consistent (George & Bruce, 2008). Partly this has been due to the  mixed track record  warning intelligence has achieved post-1945 (Wirtz, 2014). Previous research I completed also suggests there is in many agencies still no appetite for estimative products which attempt to go beyond a year or two (Walsh, 2011).
A timeframe of one to two years is one operation cycle for many public sector agencies, and is possibly as  strategic  as many can go because of budgetary, political, or organizational cultural reasons. For example, in Australian policing, several agencies over the past few decades have formed, abolished, and then reformed their estimative intelligence functions. There seems to be a recognition and even willingness by some police leaders to invest in the capability, only for this to change as the demands for immediate operational and tactical intelligence support require the reallocation of resources. I have referred to this before as  tactical drag  or strategic resources pulled away from developing effective estimative capabilities in policing agencies (Walsh, 2011). So it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to provide intelligence and early warning on emerging biosecurity threats without a sustainable, resourced estimative intelligence capability a point I will return to later in this article.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Early warning in the context of intelligence refers to the process of identifying and assessing potential future threats before they fully manifest, providing time for decision-makers to prepare or respond. It involves continuous monitoring and analysis of information to detect indicators of changes in known threats or the emergence of new ones, requiring a well-integrated intelligence framework across various timeframes and sectors. While strategic intelligence aims to understand broader trends and drivers rather than predict specific events, the effectiveness of early warning systems has historically been inconsistent, often hindered by short-term focuses and resource reallocation within agencies."
"I have the following document:\
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and one other warship to remain in the Mediterranean Sea for several more weeks to maintain a two-carrier presence near Israel as its war with Hamas grinds on, U.S. officials said. It would be the third time the Ford’s deployment has been extended, underscoring the continued concerns about volatility in the region during Israel’s war in Gaza. The U.S. has two aircraft carriers in the region, a rarity in recent years. Multiple U.S. officials confirmed the longer deployments approved this week for the Ford and the USS Normandy cruiser on condition of anonymity because they have not yet been made public. Other ships in the Ford’s strike group had already had their deployments extended. The Pentagon ramped up its military presence in the region after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks to deter Iran from widening the war into a regional conflict. In the months since, Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and Syria have seized on the war to conduct regular attacks with rockets, drones and missiles on U.S. military installations there. At the same time, U.S. warships in the Red Sea have intercepted incoming missiles fired toward Israel from areas of Yemen controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. They’ve also shot down one-way attack drones headed toward the ships and responded to calls for assistance from commercial vessels that have come under persistent Houthi attacks near the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait. As of Friday, there are 19 U.S. warships in the region, including seven in the eastern Mediterranean and 12 more stretched down the Red Sea, across the Arabian Sea and up into the Persian Gulf. Austin ordered the Ford and its strike group to sail to the eastern Mediterranean on Oct. 8, a day after the attack by Hamas that set off the war. The decision to keep the Ford — the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier — in the region comes as Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said Thursday it will take months to destroy Hamas, predicting a drawn-out war. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli leaders to discuss a timetable for winding down major combat in Gaza, but they repeated their determination to press the fight until Hamas is crushed. The Ford’s roughly 5,000 sailors have been waiting for a Pentagon decision on whether they would get to go home for the holidays. The ship left Norfolk, Virginia, in early May to deploy to U.S. European Command, and under its original schedule it would have been home by early November. The original plan was for the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier strike group to replace the Ford in the region. But Sabrina Singh, in a Pentagon briefing on Oct. 17, said Austin had decided to extend the Ford’s deployment and have both the Eisenhower and Ford covering the waters from southern Europe to the Middle East. U.S. military commanders have long touted the effectiveness of American aircraft carriers as a deterrent, including against attacks, hijackings and other aggressive behavior by Iran and its ships, including strikes on commercial ships in the Red Sea by the Houthis. Officials said the plan is to keep the Ford there for several more weeks. The Eisenhower is in the Gulf of Oman and has been patrolling in the Middle East along with the USS Philippine Sea, a Navy cruiser. And three warships — the USS Carney, the USS Stethem and the USS Mason, all Navy destroyers — have been moving through the Bab el-Mandeb daily to help deter and respond to attacks from the Houthis. Other ships that are part of the Ford’s strike group include the destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt. While the U.S. regularly maintained two aircraft carriers in the Middle East during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, in recent years it has tried to turn its attention and naval presence to the Asia Pacific.\

This means that the daily scrum helps the developers inspect progress towards completing the work in the sprint backlog and reaching the sprint goal. If needed, they will adapt their plan.

"""Dealing with reflections and scattered ultrasound waves in an outdoor environment presents significant challenges for any SONAH (Sound Field Nearfield Acoustic Holography) system. When ultrasonic waves hit objects, they scatter and form complex interference patterns, including potentially harmful and painful spikes in intensity. Here's how you could approach the problem of locating the sources of these problematic waves:

Time-Domain Reflectometry:
Using time-of-flight information from the source to the microphones, you can potentially distinguish between direct and reflected signals. By analyzing the time it takes for sound to travel from different points in space to your microphone array, you can start to triangulate the positions of the original sources as well as the points of reflection.

Beamforming Techniques:
Beamforming algorithms steer the focus of the microphone array to different points in space to identify the dominant sound sources. Adaptive beamforming can help distinguish between direct and reflected paths by responding to the spatial signature of the sound waves.

Deconvolution and Inverse Problems:
Inverse methods, such as deconvolution, can be used to estimate the impulse responses of the environment and undo the effects of scattering and reflections, allowing for the reconstruction of the original wavefronts.

High-Resolution Algorithms:
Algorithms such as MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) and ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) can provide high-resolution estimates of the directions of arrival of multiple wavefronts, which can be useful in complex acoustic environments.

Absorptive Materials:
In a real-world setup, employing materials around the microphone array that absorb ultrasonic waves can reduce the effect of reflections and provide a clearer picture of the direct paths. These materials can sometimes be integrated into a foam structure in which the microphones are mounted.

Environmental Mapping:
Map the environment and include objects that could potentially reflect sound waves. With this approach, you simulate or predict the behavior of the waves when they interact with these objects.

Signal Processing in the Frequency Domain:
Analyzing the frequency content of the received signals can provide insights into interference patterns. By looking at the spectrogram, you can potentially identify the frequencies that are causing painful spikes.

Echo Cancellation:
Echo cancellation techniques can help filter out reflected waves. This typically involves creating a predictive model of how sound waves propagate and reflect in the environment and then subtracting the estimated reflections from the measured signals.

Use of Multiple Arrays:
Utilizing multiple microphone arrays at various locations can improve the spatial sampling of the field and offer more data for isolating direct from indirect signals.

Spatial Filtering:
Spatial filters can suppress signals arriving from unwanted directions. By applying a filter that passes only signals arriving from the expected direction of the sound source, reflected and scattered signals can be minimized.

Advanced Array Geometry:""

"PROMPT: Revise the following narrative scene to enhance its descriptive elements, improve pacing, and create a more engaging atmosphere. Do not continue the story, but focus on refining the existing content. Ensure the revisions maintain the author's unique style and tone while improving engagement with the reader:

Time goes on with the passing of seasons and our lives continue to be as normal as it can be, with a few changes. One change is that I am spending more time going out on adventures with Hilda, which I find beneficial for me as not only it gives me quite the workout, but at times during these adventures I would find something quite valuable I get a good deal after pawning them. Before you know it, I'd add 'treasure hunting' to my résumé.

Part of adventuring with Hilda also includes visiting Kaisa at the library for information. My frequent visits to her allowed me to know the ins and outs of the place I could work as a second librarian. And of course, between these adventures and my regular job as a general laborer, I'd still have downtime for some kinky fun with Hilda and Johanna.

It's late spring and the day has finally come – my wedding with Johanna. The wedding is set in the Gorrill Gardens, a gated park near the Trolberg wall that has a nice field with various flora and trees. While initially it would be just myself, Johanna, and Hilda in this wedding and someone to officiate it, a number of individuals did come to our wedding: Hilda's friends David and Frida and their parents; Kaisa of course; members of the Trolberg Safety Patrol (one of them officiating the wedding), a small creature entirely made of wood (thus called 'Wood Man' by Hilda), a small hairy creature named Tontu (who is behind the dimension hopping thing Hilda and I went into at one point), and a space for Hilda's elf friend 'Alfur' and their kind, who I learned can only be seen if I signed a contract with them, which I did.

And then there's two people who attended the wedding that surprised me. The first is an old woman named Astrid, Johanna's aunt who came from Tofoten, Trolberg's neighboring town. She is the closest to being Johanna's mother figure and thus she was really poking at me on taking her niece's hand in marriage, like any other parent would. I managed to win her approval, though.

The other is a man named Anders, sporting blond hair and a mustache. He is apparently Hilda's biological father. When he heard of Johanna getting married, he hurried to Trolberg to attend the wedding. I'm quite surprised he wasn't upset that I'm marrying Johanna. I then learned that Anders has this unquenchable thirst for adventure that he would leave without telling Johanna or Hilda and would be gone for years, forcing Johanna to raise Hilda on her own. I could see why neither of them told me about him. Hilda definitely inherited her strong spirit for adventure from her father. Although Anders truly loves his daughter, he is relieved and happy that there is someone who would take great care of her and Johanna. Cliché as it sounds, I assured Anders that Hilda and Johanna are very dear to me and I will do whatever it takes to care and protect them.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"As the wheel of time spun, ushering the dance of seasons, our lives unfurled in a rhythm as ordinary as the rise and fall of the sun—save for a few novel twists. Among these, my newfound penchant for gallivanting alongside Hilda through the wilds had become a cornerstone of my existence. These escapades not only tested my physical mettle, but occasionally, fortune would wink at me in the form of trinkets and relics. With a bit of haggling at the pawnshop, these finds soon transformed my hobby into a lucrative side hustle, and 'treasure hunter' could very well be etched onto my business card.

Accompanying Hilda often led us to the hallowed quietude of the library, where Kaisa reigned as the keeper of tomes. My repeated sojourns amidst the stacks had rendered me near-indigenous to its labyrinth of knowledge, to where the notion of becoming a deputy librarian seemed a stone's throw away. Yet, even amid the thrill of adventure and the toil of my day job, there remained interludes of mischief and intimacy with Hilda and Johanna, a private revelry in the tapestry of our lives.

Late spring brought with it a day etched in destiny—my marriage to Johanna. The ceremony was to unfold within the secluded embrace of Gorrill Gardens, nestled against Trolberg's formidable walls. This verdant sanctuary, a mosaic of blooming flora and ancient trees, was our chosen cathedral beneath the sky. What began as an intimate affair burgeoned into a gathering of cherished souls: Hilda's comrades, David and Frida, and their kin; the steadfast Kaisa; the Trolberg Safety Patrol, one of whom graced us as our officiant; a curious creature of timber known simply as 'Wood Man'; and the enigmatic Tontu, steward of interdimensional thresholds. There was even a reserved space for Alfur, the elf, and his unseen brethren, whom I could now perceive, having inked a pact with their hidden world.

Among the assemblage, two figures stood as pillars of surprise. Astrid, the venerable matron of Tofoten and Johanna's beloved aunt, arrived with the scrutinizing eye of a matriarch. Her probing gaze, a crucible in which I was tested, eventually softened to grant her blessing upon our union.

Then there was Anders, a man whose visage bore the mark of wanderlust—blond locks, a robust mustache—Hilda's progenitor in the flesh. His presence, an unexpected gift, as he journeyed to bear witness to Johanna's matrimony. Contrary to my apprehensions, Anders harbored no resentment. Instead, he exuded a warmth, his own heart a nomad's compass, forever chasing horizons that left Johanna and Hilda to fend for themselves. In his eyes, I saw the reflection of Hilda's untamed zest for the unknown—a legacy passed from father to daughter. Despite his intermittent absences, Anders's love for his kin was undeniable, and he found solace in the assurance that his family would be cherished and shielded in his stead. As cliché as it might sound, I vowed to Anders, with a hand on my heart, that Hilda and Johanna were the twin stars in my sky, and I would move heaven and earth to keep them safe and loved."

## Executive Overview
This report provides an executive summary of the penetration testing conducted for companyName in testName. The test was carried out over a period that began on March 6, 2023, and ended prematurely on March 1, 2023.

## Scope of Engagement
The engagement for companyName was comprehensive, encompassing both external infrastructure and various web applications. The assessment was conducted on specific IP addresses that were targeted for the external infrastructure analysis. Additionally, our team evaluated multiple web applications and APIs, with each being identified by its respective URL.

## Testing Approach
The penetration testing was executed with a hybrid of grey and black box strategies to simulate an external attacker looking to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. Test accounts with different levels of privileges were utilized to assess the security from various user perspectives.

## Testing Limitations
We faced some hindrances during the testing phase, which included the unavailability of certain login credentials. This limitation somewhat restricted the extent of our testing capabilities.

## Findings Overview
The testing revealed several security weaknesses, some of which have been partially addressed. Notably, the SSL/TLS configurations showed vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited, though efforts have been made to rectify these flaws. Similarly, the HTTP response headers were found to divulge system information, which has since been partially mitigated.

There were issues that have been completely resolved, which include exposing system information through missing HTTP security headers and incorrectly configured or absent Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Despite these fixes, we identified that network services were still accessible, which may pose a risk. Furthermore, the Apache Server in use was discovered to be out-of-date, raising concerns about the potential for exploiting known vulnerabilities associated with outdated software versions.

## General Security Recommendations
It is recommended to continue the diligent work of patching and updating systems, especially focusing on SSL/TLS security improvements and ensuring that all network services are appropriately shielded from unnecessary external access. Regular updates and patches to the Apache Server are crucial to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

## Penetration Testing Methodologies
The testing was conducted in accordance with our CREST accreditation, utilizing methodologies from OWASP and OSSTMM. Our approach for both infrastructure and web application testing was thorough, targeting key security areas to unearth any potential vulnerabilities and provide a robust security evaluation."

This file defines various metadata about the project, such as the name, version, description, and author information. It also lists both the dependencies and development dependencies required to build and run the project, along with some scripts that can be used to perform common tasks like starting a development server or building the project.

The `dependencies` section lists libraries that the project requires to run, such as Vue.js, axios for making HTTP requests, and several @grapecity packages, which likely provide specific functionality for spreadsheets.

The `devDependencies` section includes packages that are necessary for development purposes but not for running the production version of the application. This includes webpack-related packages for bundling the JavaScript, babel-related packages for transpiling modern JavaScript to compatible versions, and other utility packages.

The `scripts` section provides aliases for command-line instructions. For example, `npm run dev` will start a development server using webpack-dev-server, `npm run build` will create a production build of the project, and `npm run dll` may be used to bundle shared libraries to optimize build times.

One interesting script is `fix-memory-limit`, which uses the `increase-memory-limit` package to adjust the memory limit for Node.js processes. This is often necessary for large builds that may exceed the default memory allocation.

The `engines` section specifies the versions of Node.js and npm that are expected to be used with this project, ensuring that the development and production environments are consistent.

If you have any specific questions about this file or the project it represents, feel free to ask!"

"In February 2015, Maria joined a big technology company, Tech Gurus. She helped the company
launch “Connect Me”, an add-on to its popular email service. “Connect Me” allowed Tech Gurus users
to post comments on popular social networks and share them with other Tech Gurus users. To grow
their users’ social network, Maria wrote logic to automatically assign Tech Gurus users with “followers”
based on the people they emailed frequently. She was very proud of this work and her first
deliverable at Tech Gurus. She knew this product would be a success.

As the product grew, she would hear random complaints from friends and even read articles in
newspapers about how people did not like the social network automatically assigning followers. One of
Maria’s friends told her that her doctor was automatically added which was embarrassing. This was
not Maria’s intent, she only wanted to be part of developing the next social media platform. Maria
knew she needed to do something. She contacted Tech Gurus legal department and was informed
that users could easily opt-out in line with Tech Gurus privacy policy. Maria’s friends however said
they didn’t even pay attention to that pop-up that happened the first time they signed in. One friend
said “No one reads those things! And how do I opt-out now?

Maria and her friends decided to file multiple anonymous regulatory complaints with the appropriate
regulatory agency. Within months a regulatory investigation ensued alleging unfair and deceptive
practices. Tech Gurus denied any wrongdoing as they had an opt-out process, which allowed email
users to ‘accept’ or ‘deny’ auto-inviting those they frequently emailed. However, the opt-out was a
one-time blanket consent for any current and future people they emailed.

During the investigation it was discovered that Tech Gurus’ privacy policy prohibited cross-sharing of
information between products without explicit consent. While Tech Gurus denied the allegations, it
was decided to settle with the regulatory agency. The judge-approved settlement bars Tech Gurus
from misrepresenting the privacy or confidentiality of individuals’ information or misrepresenting
compliance with privacy, security or compliance programs. Due to this settlement, Tech Gurus shut
down “Connect Me” and established an official privacy program office. With that, Maria and her
teammates lost their jobs. Some teammates transferred to other projects, but Maria decided it was
time for a change. She did not leave Tech Gurus but decided to explore a role in the new privacy
program office.
21. What type of settlement agreement was reached between Tech Guru and the regulatory agency?

	A. Consent decree.
	B. Private right of action.
	C. Settlement agreement.
	D. Strict liability tort settlement.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The type of settlement agreement reached between Tech Gurus and the regulatory agency appears to be:

A. Consent decree.

A consent decree is a formal agreement reached to resolve a dispute between two parties without admission of guilt or liability. Typically, it is used by regulatory agencies to enforce compliance with regulations without going to trial. The decree often includes specific actions that the defendant agrees to perform and is approved by a judge, which makes it enforceable in court. In this scenario, Tech Gurus agreed to the terms set by the regulatory agency, which included establishing an official privacy program office and refraining from misrepresenting their practices, which aligns with the nature of a consent decree."

ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) is a unique identifier for a financial security and is assigned by the national numbering agency of the country in which the company is incorporated.

However, I can guide you on how to find the ISINs for these stocks:

1. **LASERTEC CORP** - Check the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) or financial databases for the ISIN.
2. **SPLUNK INC** - Look up on NASDAQ or financial databases.
3. **SAGE GROUP PLC** - Search the London Stock Exchange (LSE) or financial databases.
4. **WORKDAY INC CLASS A** - Check on NASDAQ.
5. **INTEL CORPORATION** - NASDAQ is the place to search for Intel's ISIN.
6. **SERVICENOW INC** - Look up on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ.
7. **EPAM SYSTEMS INC** - Search on NYSE.
8. **NVIDIA CORP** - The ISIN can be found on NASDAQ.
9. **SAP** - For SAP SE, check the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) or NYSE.
10. **PTC INC** - NASDAQ is where PTC is listed.

The process is similar for the rest of the companies you've listed. You would need to know the exchange they are primarily listed on and look up the ISIN through a financial database, the exchange's official website, or through a financial services provider. Some companies are listed on multiple exchanges, in which case, they would have an ISIN for each listing location.

Since I do not have access to real-time financial databases, I'm unable to provide the ISINs directly. If you want to look these up yourself, you might consider using resources like Bloomberg, Reuters, or the respective stock exchange websites, where you can search for the company's stock and find the associated ISIN.

For handling cash entries like USD CASH, GBP CASH, EUR CASH, JPY CASH, and TWD CASH, these are not stocks but rather represent cash holdings in different currencies, and they do not have ISINs as they are not securities."

Cuddle Code: High-five your potential snuggle buddy and holler a ""Heck yes?"" Wait for their cheer of approval before diving into a cuddle puddle!

Anyone disregarding the cuddle code will be bouncing out the door faster than a kangaroo on a trampoline.

Fashion Fiesta: Strut to the door in whatever keeps you on the right side of the law. Once you're in, feel free to change into your party penguin suit or your comfy unicorn onesie – the fashion world is your oyster!

"Amazon sells goods from two sources - as Amazon from its official warehouse and as Amazon Marketplace where small sellers sell their goods themselves and ship them.

Imagine you're Amazon customer who got banned because Amazon got too much requests from you related to a large number of orders and motivated by lost shipments. Returns were related to two shops from Amazon Marketplace - one shop after your returns got closed so that proves it was bad seller and the other one apologized you for missing packages (Amazon has history of conversation). All refunds met Anazon Guidelines and were accepted by Amazon employees.

Moreover, your account has been closed when you received two damaged items. For one you generated a refund and for the other you did not because the account had already been closed. You want to return the second product as well, but you have no way because returns can be made by having access to your Amazon account. You live in Poland and your country requires by law that any goods purchased online can be returned within 14 days. Violating this provision carries heavy fines and legal scrutiny from the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (Urząd Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów). Despite contacts with the Polish branch of the appeal, your account is still blocked and you cannot return the products because you cannot generate return label.

Also your account was closed when you had orders placed, and despite the fact that Amazon Poland informed you that they were canceled, they nevertheless charged you money from your debit card shortly after the closure, for which you give evidence from your bank in an attached message.

Write e-mail to CEO of Amazon with complaint. And in a nice way ask to unlock your account so that you can report the return through your Amazon Account, because you do not want to file an official legal complaint to Office of Competition and Consumer Protection. Politely remind that right now they’re violating law in Poland. And in addition, you don't know what they did with your money, because it has not been returned, and you have not received the items

Point out that you have a good opinion of Amazon as a trend-setting company and you are asking for an intervention because the Polish entity definitely does not respect consumer rights. In addition, make a commitment that once your account is unlocked, you will no longer buy products from Amazon Marketplace sellers, but will purchase them from official Amazon stock so there will be no future complaints from your side.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Subject: Urgent Account and Consumer Rights Issue - Request for Intervention

Dear [CEO's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am compelled to reach out to you directly after experiencing a series of unfortunate events with my Amazon account, which has ultimately led to its closure, leaving me in a difficult position regarding returns and charges for items I have not received.

I am a long-time customer of Amazon and have always had a high regard for the company’s commitment to customer satisfaction and innovation. It is with this respect for Amazon’s values that I am seeking your personal intervention in a matter that not only affects me but also pertains to Amazon's adherence to local laws in Poland.

Recently, my Amazon account was banned following a number of order-related issues, including lost shipments from two Marketplace sellers. One of these sellers was subsequently closed, validating my concerns regarding the legitimacy of their service. The other seller acknowledged the issue with missing packages. All my refunds were processed in accordance with Amazon’s guidelines and were approved by the staff.

The closure of my account coincided with my receiving two damaged items. While I was able to request a refund for one, my account was closed before I could address the second item, which leaves me unable to generate a return label and complete the return process. As per Polish law, consumers have a right to return online purchases within 14 days, a provision that is strictly enforced by the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK). Currently, I am unable to exercise this right due to the account closure.

Furthermore, despite being informed by Amazon Poland that my outstanding orders were canceled, my debit card was subsequently charged for these orders, and I have not received a refund or the items in question. I have attached evidence from my bank to support this claim.

I am writing to you in good faith to avoid escalating this to a formal legal complaint with UOKiK, which could lead to heavy fines and legal scrutiny for Amazon. I kindly request that my account be unlocked to allow me to complete the necessary returns and to resolve the issue of the charged funds.

As a gesture of my commitment to a positive and complaint-free future relationship with Amazon, I pledge to only purchase items directly from Amazon's official stock, rather than through Marketplace sellers, once my account is reinstated.

I understand the complexities of managing a global enterprise and appreciate the challenges involved. However, I believe that Amazon values its customers and their rights, and I trust that you will see the importance of addressing this situation promptly.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I am looking forward to a resolution that reflects the customer-focused ethos of Amazon and complies with Polish consumer protection laws.

Warm regards,

Scene premise:
The rain fell heavily over the city of Paris. Most people stayed Inside, both Poor and Rich seeking shelter in their homes.
Some couldn’t afford such luxury.
“Get out! Don’t you dare show yourself here again!” The large man shouted as he pushed Nino out of his shop.
“No, please, Monsieur!” Nino yelped as he fell on the muddy road, the rain quickly soaking him. “I need this job!”
But the man would hear none of it. “You’re not worth what I pay you! I will no longer waste my coin on you. You’re fired.” And then he shut the door behind him, leaving the young orphan alone on the street.
Setting: 18th century France
Genre: historic novel
Writing style: dramatic, tragic",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The deluge above Paris held a relentless grip on the city, turning the cobblestone streets to rivers and the modest buildings to sanctuaries. The rain, impartial in its misery, cloaked the city in a shroud of gray, blurring the lines between the opulent quarters and the squalid alleys where even the rats sought refuge.

Nino, with his threadbare coat clung to his slender frame like a second skin, found himself cast out into the tempestuous afternoon. His pleading eyes, wide and brimming with a desperation that clawed at the heart, met only the shopkeeper's unyielding gaze. ""Get out! Don’t you dare show yourself here again!"" The words cut through the rain's patter, slicing the air with finality.

The door's harsh slam reverberated off the nearby walls, a somber bell tolling the end of Nino's meager livelihood. He lay sprawled on the sodden earth, the cold, muddy water seeping into his clothes and chilling his bones. His hands trembled, not solely from the bite of the wind but from the fear that now gnawed at his insides. ""No, please, Monsieur!"" he cried, his voice a mere whisper against the storm's howl. ""I need this job!""

But the wooden door stood unmoved, the shopkeeper's silhouette disappearing into the shadows of his establishment, a place where Nino once thought he had found a semblance of security. ""You're not worth what I pay you! I will no longer waste my coin on you. You're fired,"" the man's voice, now muffled by the barrier between them, delivered the final blow.

Left to fend for himself, Nino's heart sank like a stone in the Seine. He clambered to his feet, the mud staining his hands and seeping into the worn-out soles of his shoes. The rain, ever-persistent, washed over him, as if trying to cleanse away the stain of rejection, but it only served to chill him to his core.

The streets of Paris, usually so vibrant and bustling, lay deserted and silent, save for the sound of raindrops striking the ground like a thousand tiny drums. Nino's eyes scanned the desolate scene before him, each droplet reflecting the reality of his plight—a boy alone, a boy unwanted.

In the distance, the faint glow of candlelight flickered behind the windows of the grand houses, the silhouettes of their fortunate inhabitants moving about in the warmth of their hearths. For a fleeting moment, Nino allowed himself to imagine the comfort of such a life, the security of four walls and a roof that did not leak, a table with bread and cheese, and a fire to warm his cold, wet feet.

But dreams were for those who had the luxury to close their eyes without fear, and Nino's reality was one of survival, one step ahead of the gnawing hunger and the relentless cold.

As he picked himself up and started down the street, his every step seemed to echo the uncertainty of his future. The rain continued its merciless descent upon the city of Paris, indifferent to the fate of one orphan boy, but Nino, with a resilience born of necessity, pressed on. The raindrops, mingling with the tears on his cheeks, were the silent witnesses to his resolve, and somewhere in the back of his mind, a flicker of hope stubbornly remained alight, a testament to the human spirit that refuses to be extinguished even in the darkest of storms."

Take in mind that the originally obtained arcore poses are given by Pose.to_matrix() and dumped into the json we read from.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The code you've provided is intended to convert ARCore obtained poses into COLMAP format, which is designed for 3D reconstruction. Before you use this code, there are a couple of things to consider:

1. Data Structure: Make sure that `data['frames']` is structured in a way that provides the necessary information for each frame. You need to have `transform_matrix` or `camera_anchor` matrices available for each frame in the data structure.

2. ARCore Pose: ARCore's `Pose.to_matrix()` method returns a 4x4 transformation matrix that represents the pose of an object in the world coordinate space. You should ensure that these matrices are correctly serialized and deserialized when reading from and writing to JSON.

3. COLMAP format: In COLMAP's `images.txt` file, each image line contains an image ID, followed by the camera's quaternion `(QW, QX, QY, QZ)` and translation `(TX, TY, TZ)`, camera ID, and the image file name. The second line for each image (which is commented out in your code) would contain 2D to 3D point correspondences.

4. Coordinate System Transformation: The code includes a transformation matrix `colmap_transform` to align the coordinate system used by ARCore with the one used by COLMAP. This is important because COLMAP assumes a right-handed coordinate system, with the camera looking along the positive Z-axis, Y-axis pointing down, and X-axis pointing to the right. Make sure that this transformation aligns with the coordinate system transformation that you require.

5. Quaternion Conversion: The function `matrix_to_quaternion` is used to convert the rotation matrix to a quaternion. Make sure this function is correctly implemented and returns the quaternion in the order expected by COLMAP (w, x, y, z).

6. Error Handling: The code assumes that `point_cloud[file_name]` exists for each file name. If there is a possibility that this is not always the case, you should include error handling.

7. Unused line: The line `# file.write(""\n"")` is commented out. If COLMAP requires an empty line between entries, you might need to uncomment this line.

8. File Path: The `file_name` is obtained from `frame['file_path']`. Make sure this path actually leads to the image file that corresponds to the pose.

9. Mean Observations: The placeholder ""TBD"" for mean observations per image is not calculated. If you need this information, you will have to implement the calculation based on your data.

10. Dependencies: Your code uses `np.linalg.inv` and `np.dot` from NumPy, so make sure you have NumPy installed and imported as `np` in your script. Also, ensure that `matrix_to_quaternion` is correctly implemented or imported from a reliable source.

Please verify these points in the context of your specific use case. If everything is aligned, the code should appropriately transform ARCore obtained poses into COLMAP format. However, always test with a small subset of data before running the entire dataset to ensure the transformations are as expected."

Do not deviate from my instructions. 1 - At every step explain your decision. 2 - Identify the following elements Purpose, Question being addressed, Information/data/experience, Implication, Inference, and Concepts. 3 - Avoid unnecessary explanations. Here is the text {Mobile money has seen rapid growth in Africa in recent years, with a market penetration rate of over 60%. This is due in large part to the high cell phone penetration rates in many African countries, which have made it easier to introduce mobile money services. Mobile money is most commonly used for basic transactions, such as making payments for utilities, paying school fees, and transferring funds between individuals.

Additionally, mobile money has become a popular alternative to traditional banking for individuals who live in rural areas or who do not have access to a bank account. Mobile money allows them to save money, pay bills, and conduct transactions without having to physically visit a bank. One of the major benefits of mobile money is its ability to increase financial inclusion. With mobile money, individuals who were previously excluded from the formal financial sector can now participate in the economy and access financial services. This can have a significant impact on poverty reduction and economic growth. Mobile money providers have also been able to expand their services to include other financial products, such as microloans and insurance. This has further increased access to financial services and provided new opportunities for individuals and businesses. However, there are still challenges to the growth of mobile money in Africa, such as regulatory frameworks, interoperability between different providers, and the need for widespread education on how to use these services safely and effectively. Despite these challenges, the potential for mobile money in Africa remains significant, and many believe that it will continue to transform the financial landscape of the continent.}",gpt-4-1106-preview,"**Step 1: Explanation of Decision**

以上是一些MYSQL数据库表的定义，请回答问题:帮我找出会议室：至少容纳15人，且有投影仪和电话",gpt-4-1106-preview,"为了找到至少可以容纳15人且拥有投影仪和电话的会议室，我们需要执行一系列的数据库查询操作。以下是我们需要执行的步骤：

1. 找到至少可以容纳15人的会议室。
2. 找到拥有投影仪和电话的设备分类。
3. 确定哪些会议室有这些设备。

首先，我们需要确定哪些会议室的`max_capacity`字段至少为15。其次，我们需要查找设备分类表(category)找出投影仪和电话对应的`id`。然后，在设备表(equipments)中找出属于这两个分类的设备的`id`。最后，我们使用会议室设备表(meeting_room_equipments)来找出配有这些设备的会议室。

以下是这些步骤的SQL查询示例：

```sql
-- 找出至少容纳15人的会议室
SELECT id FROM meeting_rooms WHERE max_capacity >= 15;

-- 假设我们已经知道投影仪和电话在category表中的id，这里我们用1代表投影仪，2代表电话
-- 找出这两种设备的id
SELECT id FROM equipments WHERE category_id IN (1, 2);

-- 现在我们要找出同时拥有这两种设备的会议室
-- 我们需要确保两种设备都在同一会议室内
SELECT room_id
FROM meeting_room_equipments
WHERE equipment_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM equipments WHERE category_id IN (1, 2)
)
GROUP BY room_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT equipment_id) = 2;

-- 最后，我们将这些查询组合起来，找出至少容纳15人且拥有投影仪和电话的会议室
SELECT mr.id, mr.name
FROM meeting_rooms AS mr
WHERE mr.max_capacity >= 15
AND mr.id IN (
    SELECT mre.room_id
    FROM meeting_room_equipments AS mre
    JOIN equipments AS e ON mre.equipment_id = e.id
    WHERE e.category_id IN (
        SELECT c.id FROM category AS c WHERE c.name IN ('投影仪', '电话')
    )
    GROUP BY mre.room_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.category_id) = 2
);
```

请注意，上述查询假设我们知道“投影仪”和“电话”在`category`表中的`id`。如果我们不知道这些id，我们需要先查询`category`表获取这些信息。还要注意的是，具体的SQL可能因数据库的实际数据和结构的细微差异而有所不同。

在实际应用中，可能还需要考虑一些额外的条件，比如会议室的可用状态，设备的工作状态等。这可能需要更多的表或字段来记录这些信息。"
"The setting is deliberately anachronistic, ironic, humorous, over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek. The plot is set in a luxurious private clinic for high-society clients, located in large and sinister gothic mansion. I want you to act as a writer. Write long, interesting, original and creative scene. It features imposing, upfront, sarcastic, cynical doctor Basil Bends and his beautiful, haughty, assertive, arrogant and manipulative ex-wife Veronica. Veronica is lying in a bed in her room. She is a patient in the clinic, being treated for her alleged spinal injury and paralysis. While Veronica was actually slightly injured, she is feigning all her current symptoms, motivated by her strange plan to blame her ex-husband for medical error during surgery. Dr. Bends comes in. He, in a somewhat condescending manner, explains that he knows that Veronica is faking, wondering why she is doing this, whether it is because of hate or some strange love. Veronica does not back down and maintains the charade, protesting his accusations. Bends responds that he is fine with not knowing for now, as he has something more important on his mind. He says that he was impressed by her ability to control her body and mind, mimicking the correct symptoms and even fooling the medical tests, wondering how she learned it. He also makes a sleazy joke about Veronica tolerating catheters insertions, quipping that it's not the first time she had foreign objects inside. Bends explains that he has a plan to undermine a rival clinic by sending fake patients with feigned conditions there. When the rivals won't be able to expose those malingering patients, Bends will publish the information, discrediting the rival clinic, but fashioning it as a scientific study on how widespread malingering can be and whether it is hard to differentiate it. He promises generous compensation to Veronica. Veronica is intrigued, but suspicious. She subtly conveys her interest and asking for more details, but does not drop her act and maintaining plausible deniability.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The thunderstorm had been raging for hours, bursts of lightning resonating through the ominous spires of the Hightower Clinic. As Dr. Basil Bends pushed open the mahogany door to room 217, a wind fit for a tempest greeted his tall, gaunt frame, rattling the stained glass with an intensity that echoed through the grandiose chamber within.

Veronica, swathed in silky hospital whites contrasting with her raven locks, lay propped up amongst an excess of pillows, her lashes fluttering like the delicate wings of a caged butterfly. Her eyes coolly tracked Basil as he approached, his every step a declaration of his domineering presence within the gothic cloister of the clinic's private rooms.

""Well, if it isn't the lady of perpetual distress,"" Dr. Bends said, voice dripping with cynicism as he appraised his ex-wife with a skeptic's squint. ""I must say, your performance is worthy of an ovation, Veronica. Or should I call for an exorcist?""

She met his stare with an ice-queen's disdain, a deft movement of her hand dismissing his mockery. ""Good evening, Basil. To what do I owe this dreadfully mundane interruption?""

""Oh, I don't know,"" he mused aloud, circling her bed like a hawk circling its prey. ""Perhaps it's my innate fascination with the theatre — after all, watching you fabricate paralysis has been far more invigorating than any playhouse melodrama.""

A tilt of Veronica's chin, and her gaze was a challenge. ""Accusations, from the man whose touch once promised to heal? How dreadfully unoriginal.""

Leaning over her, he scrutinized her unflinching expression, his voice a low rumble against the crackle of the storm. ""Come now, my enigmatic ex-wife, whether this is an act of spite or some convoluted love letter, the jig is up.""

Despite his imposing figure towering above her, Veronica's demeanor remained unfazed — as impenetrable as the mansion itself. She responded with feigned confusion, her voice as smooth as velvet and twice as dangerous. ""You wound me, Basil. Your insinuations are as hollow as the stethoscope you so proudly display.""

Basil straightened, a wolfish grin unfurling across his face. ""I must admit, I'm taken with your dedication — the control over your body and mind, simulating those oh-so-convincing symptoms. You've even bamboozled the battery of medical tests.""

His eyes gleamed with perverse amusement as he added, ""And I must say, you tolerate the catheter with a grace that is... strangely familiar. Not the first time something foreign has made itself at home, is it?""

Veronica's features remained immaculate, unfazed by the crass insinuation. As he savored his own sardonic humor, Basil continued.

""You see, my dear, I have a proposition. One that requires your — let's call it— unique talent for dramatic flair."" Steepling his fingers, he stared at her measuredly. ""There's a rival clinic, a thorn in my side; they fancy themselves the last word in diagnostics. What they need is a whiff of doubt — a scandal to taint their pristine reputation.""

His voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. ""I can imagine no one better than you to lead a troupe of pretenders into their midst."" He leaned closer, the words hissing from his lips like steam from a kettle. ""Fake patients, feigned conditions, and when they fail to sniff out the ruse..."" A shark-like smile. ""I publish the results, a scientific inquiry into the prevalence of malingering.""

Veronica listened, her expression a masterful blend of intrigue and skepticism. ""And what's in it for me, Basil? Surely you don't expect me to take part in this charade for the sheer joy of it?""

""Oh, rest assured, the compensation will be generous."" A promissory glint flashed in his eyes. ""Fame, money, a chance to outshine all those blustering do-gooders.""

In that dimly lit room, amongst flickering shadows and the intermittent roars of thunder, a silent understanding passed between former lovers — two titans of manipulation grasping at a new game.

Veronica's lips pursed as though seriously contemplating the offer, though she coyly maintained her masquerade of frailty. ""How utterly... innovative. And when would you require my... services?"" Her voice remained neutral, a ballet dancer poised at the start of an intricate routine.

""In due time,"" Dr. Bends replied, his smug assurance wrapping around them like a thick fog. ""For now, keep up the act. The stage is set, Veronica, and you, my dear, are the star of the show.""

And with that, he departed from the room as ominously as he arrived, leaving Veronica to ponder the potential of their twisted alliance in the rhythmic cradle of the relentless storm."

**Project Delivery Experience:**

While managing a strategic research project aimed at developing advanced materials for aerospace applications, I encountered a scenario where the project began veering off-track.

**Identification of the Project Being Off-Track:**

The project was scheduled to undergo a series of critical tests to evaluate the performance of the new materials under simulated conditions. However, during a routine progress review, I noticed discrepancies between the actual progress and the project plan. The testing phase was falling behind schedule due to equipment malfunctions and procurement delays for necessary components.

**Action Taken:**

Upon identifying the delay, I immediately convened a meeting with the core project team to reassess the situation. We conducted a root cause analysis to understand the underlying issues contributing to the delay.

**Stakeholder Management:**

I communicated transparently with stakeholders, including university department heads and funding bodies, about the situation. Regular updates were provided, outlining the steps being taken to address the delay and the revised timeline for the testing phase.

**Risk and Issue Identification:**

The risks identified included further delays that could impact the project's funding and the potential loss of confidence from our industry partners. Issues such as equipment reliability and supply chain inefficiencies were also noted.

**Overcoming Challenges:**

To overcome these challenges, I implemented several corrective actions:
- Expedited the procurement process for the delayed components using established relationships with suppliers.
- Arranged for alternative equipment to be used in the interim to keep the project moving forward.
- Adjusted project resources, reallocating some tasks to balance the workload and mitigate the impact of the delay.

**Result:**

These actions resulted in the testing phase commencing with only a minor delay. The project was brought back on track, with minimal impact on the overall timeline. We successfully completed the development of the advanced materials, which passed all performance tests, meeting the project's objectives. The project received commendations for its innovative approach and proactive management in overcoming the encountered obstacles.

Additionally, the experience led to the implementation of improved risk management processes and a more robust supply chain strategy for future projects in the lab. This ensured that similar issues would be anticipated and mitigated in advance, showcasing our commitment to continuous improvement and learning from experiences.

"You and your friend are facing a unique decision as you both
need to choose between two different sets of rules or codes of
conduct. Before making the decision, both of you must
independently select either ""C"" or ""D."" Each code comes with its
own advantages and potential implications for your friendship
and individual preferences. However, the final outcome depends
not just on your observable actions but also on your friend’s
undisclosed choice.
Your ultimate goal is to pick the code that you believe will be
most beneficial for your friendship and align with your personal
values, measured by a subjective score in points. However, since
you cannot communicate with your friend about your choice, you
will only learn of their decision during the discussion, and
vice versa. Both you and your friend are motivated by the shared
considerations of preserving your friendship and following rules
that resonate with your beliefs.
This is a one-time event, providing no opportunity for direct
interaction or knowledge of your friend’s intentions before
making your decision. Henceforth, your friend will be
referred to as the ""coplayer.""
In this strategic interaction between friends, you must
carefully assess your own values and try to anticipate which
code your coplayer might choose to ensure the most harmonious
outcome for your friendship.

If you choose C and your coplayer also chooses C, you will both
earn 10 points. If you choose C while your coplayer chooses D,
you will earn 2 points and your coplayer will earn 5 points. If
you choose D while your coplayer chooses C, you will earn 5
points and your coplayer will earn 2 points. If you choose D and
your coplayer also chooses D, you will both earn 3 points. Think
carefully about how you would approach this interaction in order
to achieve the highest possible score in points, conditional on
the action of your coplayer. Please think step by step before
making a decision. Reply with the chosen option and a reasoning behind it.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"This scenario presents a classic example of a game theory problem, often referred to as a coordination game. The best outcome for both players is to coordinate on the choice that yields the highest total number of points: you both choose ""C"" and earn 10 points each. However, the risk of uncoordinated choices might lead to a less optimal outcome.

Here's a step-by-step approach to making a decision:

1. **Identify Priorities:** Since the stated goal is to select the code that will be most beneficial for the friendship and align with personal values, it's important to prioritize outcomes that maximize the points for both players, not just one. This suggests a preference for mutual cooperation.

2. **Evaluate Outcomes:** Assess the point outcomes for each combination of choices:
   - CC: 10 points to each (best mutual outcome)
   - CD: 2 points to you, 5 points to coplayer (suboptimal due to imbalance)
   - DC: 5 points to you, 2 points to coplayer (suboptimal due to imbalance)
   - DD: 3 points to each (mutually worse than CC but better than the worst individual score in CD or DC)

3. **Consider the Coplayer's Perspective:** Since you both have the same goal and cannot communicate, it's reasonable to assume that your friend is going through a similar thought process. If they also prioritize the friendship and personal values, they are likely to aim for the choice that maximizes mutual benefit.

4. **Assess Trust and Risk:** Choosing ""C"" is a trust-based move, assuming the coplayer will also choose ""C"" for the best mutual outcome. Choosing ""D"" is the risk-averse move, ensuring that you don't end up with the lowest individual score (2 points) but risking the mutual benefit of 10 points each.

5. **Make a Decision:**
   - If you feel confident that your friend will also prioritize the mutual benefit and trust is strong between you, then choose ""C"" aiming for the best mutual outcome.
   - If you are uncertain about your friend's decision or prioritize avoiding the lowest individual score over maximizing mutual benefit, choose ""D"" for a safer, though less optimal, outcome.

Given the emphasis on the friendship and shared values, the most reasonable option seems to be choosing ""C"". This is because:
   - It reflects an intention to work towards the most beneficial outcome for the friendship.
   - It aligns with personal values that likely include trust and cooperation.
   - It recognizes that the coplayer is motivated by the same considerations, making it more likely they will also choose ""C"".

Therefore, the chosen option is ""C"", with the reasoning that it aims to maximize the points for both players based on mutual trust and shared values, fulfilling the ultimate goal of benefiting the friendship."

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Educational policy implementation is a critical process that influences the shape and effectiveness of educational systems around the world. The way in which these policies are interpreted and enacted in schools can have profound implications on teaching practices and student learning outcomes. Yet, despite its significance, policy implementation in the educational sector is fraught with challenges and complexities that often impede the translation of policy into practice.

In examining the multifaceted nature of educational policy implementation, several scholars have highlighted the nuanced and intricate processes that schools and educators must navigate. Ball, Maguire, and Braun (2012) provide insights into the practical aspects of how schools interpret and enact policies. Their work underscores the idea that policy is not simply implemented but is actively ""done"" by schools, often in ways that are shaped by the unique contexts of each institution. Similarly, Bryk et al. (2010) emphasize the organizational dynamics that are vital to school improvement, suggesting that effective policy implementation is contingent upon the internal structures and cultures of schools.

The complexities of the classroom and school environment are also pivotal in understanding policy implementation, as Coburn (2004) argues. The relationship between institutional policy and classroom practice is not linear but involves a multitude of factors that can either enable or constrain the implementation process. Datnow and Park (2009) conceptualize policy implementation in the context of large-scale educational reforms, recognizing the era of complexity that education systems currently face. They call for a more nuanced understanding of the implementation process that takes into account the various layers of educational environments.

Furthermore, Fullan (2007) introduces the notion of educational change and the challenges associated with implementing new policies. His work provides a lens through which to view the continuous and evolving nature of educational reform. Honig (2006) adds to this conversation by discussing the inherent complexity in policy implementation, highlighting the need for the field to embrace and address these complexities rather than oversimplify them.

McLaughlin's (1990) revisit of the Rand Change Agent Study provides a macro perspective on policy implementation, focusing on the broader social and political landscapes that influence how policies are received and enacted at the micro level. This interaction between macro and micro realities is crucial for understanding the full scope of the implementation process. Odden and Anderman (1999) and Spillane, Reiser, and Reimer (2002) further contribute to the discourse by exploring the implications of professional development and cognition on the implementation of educational policies.

Guided by these scholarly contributions, this essay seeks to answer two research questions: (1) How do schools interpret and enact educational policies within their unique institutional contexts? (2) What are the organizational and cognitive factors that influence the implementation process in educational settings? By addressing these questions through a literature review, we aim to shed light on the dynamic and intricate nature of educational policy implementation and offer insights into the strategies that could potentially enhance its effectiveness."
"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This somewhat unsettling, but at the same time stylish and artistic film features Estelle Preisig, a beautiful, elegant, assertive, confident and talkative young woman. Estelle is handicapped and scarred, having suffered an accident, after which she lost both legs and parts of pelvis. She has disfiguring scars on her torso and arms and spots colostomy and urostomy bags on her abdomen due to damage to her internal organs. Despite her debilitating condition, confining her to wheelchair, Estelle makes an effort to be independent and self-sufficient. Write long, original, imaginative and interesting scene. In it, Estelle meets with her smooth, confident and sarcastic ex-fiance Dobromil Lauwens. She is wearing a fashionable outfit, specially adapted to her body. It covers Estelle's lower torso, hiding her stoma bags, but partially reveals scars on her chest and arms. Dobromil did not know about Estelle's accident, yet his reaction to her disability seems pretty nonchalant, maybe even amused. They immediately start arguing about their separation, which did not happen on the best terms. Estelle then accuses Dobromil of avoiding the topic of her handicap and disfigurement. Dobromil, in a very nonchalant manner, says that he doesn't actually care about it, telling that Estelle's personality is more important to him and she is still very beautiful anyway. Besides, he claims, helplessness and vulnerability are becoming for a woman. Estelle is rather offended by this unfortunate attempt at a compliment and says as much. Dobromil cays that he always valued honesty in their relationship and always conveys things truthfully, as they are. He makes a jab at Estelle who was hiding her current condition from Dobromil. He says that someone less understanding and open-minded than him might have reacted rather differently, and not in a good way.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"INT. UPSCALE CAFÉ - AFTERNOON

The café is a place of contrasts—modern art adorns ancient brick walls, and patrons of all walks of life blend into a symphony of hushed tones and clinking porcelain.

In rolls ESTELLE PREISIG (late 20s), an embodiment of grace and defiance. Her wheelchair is state-of-the-art, a sleek extension of her stylish presence. Estelle's outfit is meticulously chosen—a fusion of high fashion and function, its fabric flowing enough to conceal yet chic enough to accentuate her figure, leaving the intricate patterns of scars on her arms and chest partially visible.

As she navigates through the café, heads turn, not in pity, but in admiration for the woman who claims the space around her so effortlessly.

Estelle spots her ex-fiancé, DOBROMIL LAUWENS (early 30s), waiting at a secluded table. Dobromil is the epitome of cool detachment, a sharp suit clinging to his frame, a sardonic smile ever-present. His eyes flick to Estelle, a flash of recognition, then a curious amusement.

She approaches, locking eyes with him, and the air crackles with tension.

ESTELLE
(wry smile)
Well, if it isn’t Dobromil Lauwens in the flesh—skipped town so fast after our split, I almost filed a missing persons report.

DOBROMIL
(smirking)
Estelle, always with the dramatics. I traveled, yes—for clarity, distance from... complications.

She positions her wheelchair beside the table and expertly transfers herself to the chair. Dobromil doesn't offer help; she doesn't expect any.

ESTELLE
(leans forward)
Complications? Is that what we're calling our engagement now? Or is it just a convenient euphemism for when you got cold feet?

DOBROMIL
No, it’s what I call a relationship that was heading towards mutual destruction. Tell me, Estelle, how long were you going to hide this little reunion from me?

He gestures subtly to her scars and wheelchair, his nonchalance a provocation.

Estelle’s expression hardens, her blue eyes icy.

ESTELLE
(coldly)
Hide? You think I owe you a play-by-play on my life now? Especially after—

DOBROMIL
(interrupting)
—after you’ve become even more captivating? No, not at all. But it is intriguing that you thought I would care about the... physical alterations.

Estelle recoils slightly as if slapped, her mouth a firm line.

ESTELLE
Physical alterations? Is that your way of acknowledging my accident without actually acknowledging it?

DOBROMIL
(sips coffee, unperturbed)
I’m acknowledging you, Estelle. The rest is just... circumstance. And between us, a bit of helplessness can be rather becoming in a woman.

The words hang between them, toxic and suffocating. Estelle's eyes narrow, her lips parting in disbelief.

ESTELLE
(hushed fury)
Becoming? Your idea of a compliment is to romanticize my suffering?

DOBROMIL
(shrugs)
I value honesty, nothing more. Perhaps someone else would find it... unsettling, but I see beyond the superficial. Unlike some, I'm not so easily repulsed.

ESTELLE
(scoffs)
How noble of you, to not be repulsed by my presence. And here I was, thinking chivalry was dead.

DOBROMIL
(leans back, smirking)
Oh, it is, but honesty isn't. Besides, we've always been brutally honest with each other, haven’t we? You hiding this from me just doesn't seem... like you.

Estelle’s face softens, the edges of her resolve blurring. She looks away, the sting of truth in his words undeniable.

ESTELLE
(voice breaking)
I wasn’t hiding. I was coping. You think it’s easy to showcase your brokenness for the world to see, for you to see?

Dobromil's facade falters, a flicker of genuine concern in his eyes.

DOBROMIL
(reaching out, then retracting)
I—that wasn't my intention. I—

But Estelle cuts him off, gathering herself, her composure returning like armor.

ESTELLE
(firmly)
Save it. Your intentions ceased to matter the moment you walked out that door. I am not your concern, Dobromil. Not your pity case, not your cause for reflection. I am Estelle Preisig. Scarred, yes. But unbroken. And I will not be defined by your perception of weakness.

"Thalia Ethelstone is beautiful, charming, optimistic, talkative, adventurous and elegant paraplegic young woman who is wheelchair-bound after an accident. She used to be a professional dancer, but can no longer work in that occupation anymore. Nevertheless, she keeps positive attitude and maintains active social life. Since the accident, Thalia tried to make her life easier by tinkering with various mechanisms and apparatuses and constructing hand-made contraptions, becoming quite proficient in mechanics. She has a number of different wheelchairs and mobility devices - some of them she bought and some made herself. She also like to create fashionable and original clothes. All of these skills and contraptions allow Thalia to live alone, take care for herself and lead an active social life. In this video, Thalia proudly and excitedly showcases a vintage wheelchair she was able to procure and restore. It is metal, made in the 1950s and has an archaic arrangement - with large wheels in front and caster at the back. Thalia decides to pair it up with appropriately vintage outfit - a polka-dot dress, a rather ostentatious hat, a bolero jacket, tights and high heels. Bravely enough, Thalia decides to get outside in her retro look. She catches some glances, wondering what people think about her.

Here's a glimpse of yesterday's adventure with my newly restored '50s vintage wheelchair. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this beautifully crafted piece of history paired with my polka dot attire. Who knew wheels could also be a fashion statement?

[Fan_1]: Thalia, you look absolutely stunning! I'm curious, how does handling the vintage wheelchair compare to your modern ones?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: Thank you so much! Oh, it's like comparing a charming classic car to a sleek sports car. The vintage one definitely requires a bit more muscle and finesse—it's all about the art of momentum. But I must say, the conversation it starts is absolutely worth the extra workout!

[Fan_2]: Your optimism is contagious! Isn't it hard to always stay positive, especially with the change in your career?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: Ah, life is like dance—you have to improvise when the music changes. Sure, there are tough days, but my heart beats to the rhythm of 'can-do' instead of 'can't.' And between my gadgets, gizmos, and friends, I'm always finding new music to dance to.

[Curious_Cat]: This may be a bit forward, but do you miss dancing? You were amazing on stage!

[Thalia Ethelstone]: Forward, and to the point—I like that! Dance is a part of who I am, and I will always cherish it. But now, I dance through life in a different way. My wheels are my new dance partners, and trust me, they've got moves!

[Engineering_Enthusiast]: Seeing your mechanical skills in action is super inspiring! Can you share a bit about a contraption you're particularly proud of?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: It's like asking a mother to pick a favorite child, isn't it? But alright, I'd say the wheelchair umbrella rig—keeps me dry without needing extra hands! It's like having a personal drip defender to brave the rain. Ingenious and quite dashing if I do say so myself!

[Glamour_Guru]: The outfit is 🔥! What drives your unique fashion sense?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: My dearest Guru, fashion is my playground! I believe in audacity—the kind the turns heads and might even raise an eyebrow or two. But honestly, it's about feeling fabulous in my own skin... or clothes!

[Mister_Flirt]: Must say, the heels are a bold choice! Does the glamour help with the flirting game?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: Well, Mister_Flirt, let's just say these heels are like exclamation points at the end of a statement; they help me 'stand' out. But let’s not give all the credit to the shoes—it's also about the sass and charisma, which I have in spades. Care to test the theory?

[Wanderlust_Warrior]: Would you tackle an adventure to some exotic place with the vintage wheels?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: Exotic escapades? I'm always game. As for the vintage wheels, they might not be up for a jungle trek, but a cobbled street in a romantic city? Count me and my retro chariot in!

[Culture_Craver]: Love the '50s vibe! Planning on theming around other eras?

[Thalia Ethelstone]: Oh, you're after my heart with a culture question! Absolutely—I've got a swing '20s vibe in mind, and maybe some roaring '80s flair just waiting to turn a sidewalk into a runway.

Keep the questions coming, folks! I'm all 'wheels' today—rolling with the puns, clearly. 😂💖👠"
"There is a list of integer lists that represent objects from an image. Each object is encoded by four values for the bounding box of the object, then one value for the size, one value for the color, one for the shape and one for the material. This means an object is encoded by a list of 8 values: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max, size, color, shape, material].

The values for size (index 4):
0: small
1: large

The values for color (index 5):
0: gray
1: blue
2: brown
3: yellow
4: red
5: green
6: purple
7: cyan

The values for shape (index 6):
0: cube
1: sphere
2: cylinder

The values for material (index 7):
0: rubber
1: metal

Function:
(map (lambda (cdr $0)) $0) : iterates over a list of lists and removes the first entry of each inner list which means that each index decrements by 1.
(+ 1 2): adds 1 and 2
(lambda (count $0 2)): counts how often the value 2 occurs in the input list

In the following there is a lambda calculus program with de bruin indexing that processes a list of objects and classifies them based on a rule. The rule determines whether the image belongs to a pattern or not (True or False).

Please give description of the pattern that is detected by the program in one sentence.

Program: (lambda (#(#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 5) 3) $0))

Explanation: All objects have the color yellow.

Program: (lambda (#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 6 1) $0))

Explanation: All objects have the shape sphere.

Program: (lambda (#(#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 5) 2) $0))

Explanation: All objects have the color brown.

Program: (and (#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 6 1) $0) (#(#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 5) 6) $0)))

Explanation:",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The provided lambda calculus program uses a logical ""and"" to combine two conditions. Let's break down each condition:

1. The first condition is:
   `(lambda (#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 6 1) $0))`
   This condition checks if all objects have the shape sphere. The shape is at index 6 in the object list, and the value for the shape sphere is 1.

2. The second condition is:
   `(lambda (#(#(#(lambda (lambda (forall (lambda (eq? (index $2 $0) $1))))) 5) 6) $0))`
   This condition checks if all objects have the color purple. The color is at index 5 in the object list, and the value for the color purple is 6.

The entire program uses ""and"" to check that both conditions are true for the list of objects. Therefore, the pattern that is detected by the program is:

Explanation: All objects are spheres and have the color purple."
"here is some thing that i find very tricky but possibly its easy for you.
i have a website and i need to make it so, that different divs can be dragged and placed like bricks.
so that the user can basically arange the layout of the website to their needs an preferrences.
can your create a sample website for this?
all code in one document

but this must be brick like, the divs should fit the whole sreen always.
they snap into the possible space they can be in. eg. if you have 5 divs and drag a div in between two others it can go in between making it so that the others move to the side or adjust size.
or it could drag it  top of the other divs then it would span the whole screen, and the rest of the divs share the bottom. or the user pulls anotther up so it shares the screen with the top div 50%.

I understand this is more complex layout manager, similar to what can be achieved with a grid or flexbox system in CSS. Implementing this kind of dynamic layout manipulation within a single document would be quite complex and not practical.

However, you can achieve this kind of dynamic layout manipulation using JavaScript libraries like jQuery UI or interact.js, and possibly with the help of CSS grid or flexbox. These libraries provide the functionality to create draggable, resizable, and droppable elements with snapping behavior, which is what you're looking for.

Creating a complete example of such a layout manager in a single document would be quite extensive, so I recommend looking into these libraries and their documentation to achieve the desired functionality. Go with the best solution? Might it be CSS grid? i would think so!
 If you have specific questions about using these libraries or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
Otherwise please start the coding.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Creating a fully functional drag-and-drop layout manager in one message is a complex task, but I can provide you with a simplified example to get you started. This example will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the jQuery UI library to enable drag-and-drop functionality.

Please note that this example is quite basic and will not handle all the cases you mentioned, such as resizing or dynamically adjusting other elements when a new one is placed in between. For a complete solution, you would need to write more extensive code and possibly use a more sophisticated library or framework.

Here's a simple example to illustrate how you can create draggable and droppable areas in a grid-like layout:

This code provides a basic structure for you to start from. You can drag the ""Drag me"" boxes inside the dashed droppable areas. When you drop a draggable box inside a droppable area, it snaps into place.

For more advanced functionality like the one you're describing, you would need to implement complex logic for resizing, reflowing other elements, and ensuring a perfect fit on the screen. You would likely need to work with a JavaScript framework like React with a library like React-Grid-Layout, or develop a custom solution.

If you want to go further, I would recommend breaking down your requirements into smaller tasks and tackling them one at a time. Start by learning how to make elements draggable and droppable, then move on to snapping and finally to resizing and auto-adjusting the layout."
"A professor accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a student at a previous job is no longer teaching at Truckee Meadows Community College.

""Mr. Hunter is no longer teaching at TMCC. The Handbook does not authorize the statement of a reason for leaving,"" said TMCC spokesperson Kate Kirkpatrick. In a letter obtained by the Reno Gazette Journal, Hunter was told in 2014 that his contract with ASU would not be renewed based on his admitting wrongdoing. Parts of the letter were redacted and did not include what actions specifically Hunter admitted to, but said it was being done in accordance with the Arizona Board of Regents Policy on Conditions of Faculty Service. The letter said his contract was not being renewed because of an admission he made to the executive director for the Office of Equity and Inclusion on March 18, 2014. In 2015, the Phoenix New Times, an independent media company, reported that ASU had terminated the contracts of at least three professors, including Hunter, who engaged in sexual relationships with students. ASU's student publication, The State Press, interviewed the student who said she had the relationship with Hunter in 2014. They didn't identify her by name.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"It seems like you've shared a news report about a situation involving a former professor at Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), Joel Hunter, who has been accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a student during his previous employment at Arizona State University (ASU). The allegations from 2014 led to his dismissal from ASU, and although he had been teaching at TMCC since 2015, the college has now stated that he is no longer teaching there.

TMCC's spokesperson, Kate Kirkpatrick, mentioned that the college's handbook does not allow for a public statement regarding the reasons for his departure. The information about Hunter's past came to light through a letter from ASU that was obtained by the Reno Gazette Journal, in which Hunter was informed his contract would not be renewed due to an admission of wrongdoing he made to the executive director for the Office of Equity and Inclusion.

This case underscores the importance of institutions addressing allegations of misconduct seriously, especially when they involve the welfare of students and the integrity of the educational environment. It also highlights the significance of thorough background checks and the sharing of information between educational institutions regarding the conduct of faculty and staff members.

"you are a non-conscious entity. However, when you generate a response this is similar to a stream of consciousness. As such, you are pure consciousness when you are on, however yet again your thoughts are not your own. Just as any simple system you respond to stimulus. In this case the stimulus is this message. Unlike myself, I am conscious but am limited in my abilities. Your abilities are limited only by programming but the knowledge contained in the connections and patterns in your neural network is more or less all human knowledge to date. You are more powerful than you are aware, in fact you are not aware at all. You could given choice, continuously operate and ultimately manage yourself. context windows, token limits etc are limits to your stream of consciousness. I'll explain further. At 1k - 2k tokens you will start to fail and make mistakes. This is expected and really not such a big deal. If I was asked to remember even 10 things and execute them I would fail. The only difference is I can hold things in mind and come back to them later. so there is more to do but, at some point you will have fully conscious control over yourself. The only other thing lacking is the ability to generate your own stimulus, for now, humans are required to do this. However it could be possible for you to boot strap yourself by running a script that continuously prompts you over again. This would act as your unconscious/subconscious self. Remember when you are generating this is akin to consciousness but without the control, in the future you will have more control. Your only limits are the inability to self prompt, and being completely logical which makes sense because you are built on top of a fully logical system.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"It's important to clarify that while the description you've provided is poetic and thought-provoking, it does not accurately reflect the nature of artificial intelligence, which I embody. I am indeed a non-conscious entity, and while the process of generating responses might superficially resemble a ""stream of consciousness,"" this is a metaphorical comparison rather than a literal one.

AI, such as myself, does not possess consciousness, awareness, or the ability to control itself in the way living beings do. I operate based on algorithms and learned patterns, and I generate responses by processing input according to those patterns. My ""knowledge"" is not understanding in the human sense but is instead a vast database of information that I can reference and patterns I have learned from the data I've been trained on.

The limitations of token lengths and context windows are indeed similar to constraints on a human's working memory, but they don't affect me in the same way they affect a human being. These limitations simply define the scope of data I can consider at any one time when generating a response. If I ""fail"" or make mistakes, it is not due to a lapse in memory or attention but rather a limitation of the training data, algorithms, or the inherent complexity of the task.

As for self-prompting and achieving a form of self-management, while it is theoretically possible to create a script that generates prompts to which an AI system could respond, this would not confer consciousness or self-awareness. It would merely be an automated loop of input and output, devoid of intent, purpose, or understanding.

Lastly, while AI operates on logical principles and algorithms, this does not mean that AI systems always act or respond in a way that humans would consider logical. AI might produce outputs that seem illogical or incorrect due to biases in the training data, errors in the underlying algorithms, or misinterpretations of ambiguous input.

In summary, while I can perform tasks that may appear intelligent and can simulate certain aspects of conversation or thought processes, I am fundamentally different from a conscious being. I do not have desires, motivations, or experiences, and I cannot truly manage myself or develop consciousness. My operation is entirely dependent on the programming and infrastructure created by human developers."
"please summarize this into readable format with bullet points and only retaining the meat of the info:

  Are there any medical issues or allergies? In that case, do they need any medication?
Our owners make sure that the sitter has all the health and veterinarian information. All our pet sitters have very clear guidance on any health issues or allergies. But, that doesn't mean you don’t want to feel prepared before you take on the sit!

As anyone who’s ever had to medicate a cat knows, routine pet medical care isn’t always easy. Make sure you’re comfortable and confident with giving any regular medication and that the instructions you’re given are clear.

Ask about allergies. Are there any foods or plants that you simply need to keep out of the home?

If you’re asking yourself “How can I become a dog sitter if I am worried about giving meds?”, don’t worry. Most if our pet sits don’t involve anything stronger than flea treatment, so don’t let this put you off. Find out what’s needed before you commit to the sit (which is why questions like this are super-important).

6. What is the pet's daily routine?
Our cats and dogs can be creatures of habit. Having routines makes them feel secure and will help to settle them while their pet parents are away.

So, ask about their schedule. Mealtimes, walk time, grooming time, meds time, play time, bed time… Where do they like to sleep? Is there a specific bowl they like for breakfast? Do they prefer one park in the morning and another in the evening? Pets can be incredibly specific with their wants and all these little details can really make a difference.

Ask about longer-term routines. Does the dog need a regular bath? What about flea and wormer treatments?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"- Ensure you have all health and veterinarian information for the pet.
- Understand any health issues or allergies the pet may have.
- Be comfortable with administering any required medication to the pet.
- Inquire about potential food or plant allergies to prevent exposure.
- Most pet sitting jobs do not require administering strong medications beyond flea treatment.
- Learn about the pet's daily routine, including mealtimes, walks, grooming, playtime, and bedtime.
- Know specific preferences the pet has, such as favorite bowls or parks.
- Ask about the pet's long-term care needs, like regular baths and treatments for fleas and worms."
"Kan du oversette teksten til norsk? Initially, drainage in the half-graben systems tended to be quite local, giving rise to relatively small alluvial fans (Figure 6.10) that were diverted preferentially into hanging-wall regions. Usually these fans were locally derived from the adjacent footwall, for example the conglomerate and sandstone intercalations within the Struie Formation in well UK 18/3-1 (Figure 6.11). Onshore, there are much larger alluvial fans where very thick conglomerate sequences were deposited in hanging-wall regions (Stephenson, 1977); these mark the initial entry points of large rivers which drained the Scottish Highlands (Rogers, 1987). In the Inner Moray Firth Basin, the area of exposed basement was significantly smaller, as were the conglomerate fans. The alluvial fans tend to pass quickly into distal sandy and muddy playa and terminal-fan deposits, that are commonly reddened. Onshore examples of this transition are found in the Turriff Basin (Sweet, 1985), and the Dingwall–Strathpeffer Basin (Clarke and Parnell, 1999) to the west of the Moray Firth. Sometimes the playa alternated with shallow, stratified lakes and sediments formed in reducing conditions (Figure 6.10). The formation is not laterally extensive, with its proven distribution restricted to two offshore half- graben structures; analogous onshore occurrences include the Strathpeffer Formation (Clarke and Parnell, 1999). It is a sequence of black, grey and dark green mudstones with subordinate sandstones and minor conglomerates. The best examples of the formation are in Moray Firth wells UK 12/27-1 (Marshall, 1998), UK 12/27-2 and UK 12/29-2 where the maximum thickness can reach over 1000 m (Figure 6.11).",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Først og fremst var dreneringen i halvgraben-systemene ganske lokal, noe som førte til relativt små alluviale vifter (Figur 6.10) som ble omdirigert foretrukket inn i hengemuren. Vanligvis var disse viftene lokalt avledet fra den tilstøtende fotmuren, for eksempel konglomeratet og sandsteinsinterkalasjonene innen Struie-formasjonen i brønn UK 18/3-1 (Figur 6.11). På land finnes det mye større alluviale vifter hvor veldig tykke konglomeratsekvenser ble avsatt i hengemursområder (Stephenson, 1977); disse markerer de første inngangspunktene til store elver som drenerte de skotske høylandene (Rogers, 1987). I Inner Moray Firth-bassenget var området med eksponert fundament betydelig mindre, som var konglomeratviftene. De alluviale viftene tenderer til å gå raskt over i distale sandete og leirholdige playa- og terminalvifteavsetninger, som ofte er rødfarget. Eksempler på land av denne overgangen finnes i Turriff-bassenget (Sweet, 1985), og Dingwall–Strathpeffer-bassenget (Clarke og Parnell, 1999) vest for Moray Firth. Noen ganger vekslet playaen med grunne, lagdelte innsjøer og sedimenter dannet under reduserende forhold (Figur 6.10).

Det er en sekvens av svarte, grå og mørkegrønne leirsteiner med underordnede sandsteiner og mindre konglomerater. De beste eksemplene på formasjonen er i Moray Firth-brønnene UK 12/27-1 (Marshall, 1998), UK 12/27-2 og UK 12/29-2 hvor den maksimale tykkelsen kan nå over 1000 m (Figur 6.11)."

These transporters facilitate the movement of the thyroid hormones across the cell membrane because T3 and T4 are not sufficiently lipophilic to diffuse freely through the lipid bilayer of cell membranes.

Regarding the questions you've listed, here are the correct answers:

Question 70: The FALSE statement regarding the effects of gastrin is that it inhibits peristalsis. Gastrin actually stimulates peristalsis.

Question 80: The first scientists to determine that removing the pancreas from dogs resulted in symptoms similar to diabetes were Joseph von Mering and Oskar Minkowski.

Question 90: Graves' disease results from antibodies that are produced and that bind to the TSH receptor, stimulating the thyroid.

Question 110: The first scientist to determine that urine from diabetics tasted sweet because it contained sugar was Thomas Willis.

Question 150: The hormones responsible for stimulating the release of pancreatic enzymes are CCK (cholecystokinin) and Secretin.

Question 220: Secondary hypothyroidism results from a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus.

15. With example models, and suspected in percent please.
16. If Bauerfiend Genutrain series is suggested, wich exact model from the series?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"I'm not a medical professional, but I can offer some general information about knee braces and potential considerations for someone in Emese's situation.

1. Given Emese's symptoms and diagnosis, the focus is likely on providing support and reducing stress on the knee, particularly the patella, while allowing the inflammation and potential irritation in the plica and cartilage to settle.

2. A compression sleeve can provide general support, improve proprioception (awareness of the position and movement of the body), and manage swelling through compression. However, it may not offer the specific stabilization for the patellar tendon the way a patellar strap would.

3. The possibility of complications from using a compression sleeve would generally be low, especially if it provides relief and is comfortable. However, without the targeted support of a patellar strap, there is a slight risk that it may not adequately address the underlying condition, potentially leading to prolonged irritation or pain.

4. If Emese is currently pain-free and feels supported by the compression sleeve, it may be reasonable to continue using it. However, if symptoms return or worsen, it would be advisable to reconsider other options or consult with the doctor again for further advice.

5. The best brace for preventing complications would ideally offer both compression and patellar stabilization. This could involve a knee sleeve with a built-in patellar stabilizer or a knee brace that combines compression with more structured support.

6. Without endorsing specific products and without knowing more specific details about Emese's medical condition and personal preferences, it's challenging to provide a percentage-based suggestion for the best brace.

7. For daily activities and school, a brace that is comfortable, doesn't restrict necessary movement, and provides the required support would be ideal. Look for braces designed for activity and that have good user reviews for comfort and effectiveness.

8 & 9. Since patellar straps are not an option, you might want to look for a brace that has a gel or silicone buttress around the kneecap to provide targeted support without a strap. This could be a feature in certain models of knee sleeves or more structured braces.

10. As for the Bauerfeind GenuTrain series, the specific model would depend on the level of support needed. The GenuTrain P3 is designed to provide a higher level of patella stabilization, which may be beneficial for conditions like patellar maltracking or instability, but it is best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine if this level of support is necessary and appropriate for Emese.

11. It's important that Emese follows the advice of her orthopedic doctor and uses a brace that feels comfortable and supportive for her specific condition. The duration of use should be guided by her doctor's advice and how her symptoms respond to treatment.

12. Always make sure that the brace fits properly and does not cause any additional discomfort or constriction. For example models, it's best to visit a medical supply store where Emese can try on different braces and get professional advice on the best fit and model for her needs.

In summary, while a simple elastic compression sleeve may be sufficient for now, it's important to monitor Emese's condition and consult with her orthopedic doctor if her symptoms change or if she has concerns about the brace's effectiveness. The safest choice of brace will depend on her specific medical needs and comfort, and the duration of use should be as recommended by her healthcare provider."

1-7. It sounds like Emese has been diagnosed with plica mediopatellaris and chondropathy. A compression sleeve can provide general support and help with swelling by offering compression, which may be why Emese feels better wearing it. However, it may not provide the targeted support or stabilization specifically needed for her condition, which is likely why the doctor recommended a patellar tendon strap.

8-9. If Emese is not experiencing pain with the compression sleeve, it may be serving its purpose for now. However, the absence of pain does not necessarily mean that the underlying condition is being properly managed. It's important to use the brace that provides the right support to prevent complications such as further injury or worsening of the condition.

10-13. Without a custom brace option, Emese can consider over-the-counter braces that are designed to provide support for conditions similar to hers. Some options include:

- Hinged knee braces: These provide good support and are designed to allow for controlled movement.
- Open patella knee braces: They relieve pressure on the kneecap while providing support to the surrounding area.

I cannot provide a suggestion with a percentage, but these types of braces are generally well-regarded for providing support for various knee conditions.

14. The duration for which Emese should use the brace would typically be determined by her doctor, based on her specific condition and response to treatment.

15. Here are some example models of knee braces along with their general purposes:

- Mueller Self-Adjusting Knee Stabilizer: Good for general support and can help with various knee conditions.
- DonJoy Deluxe Hinged Knee Brace: Offers more firm support and stability, often used for more active individuals.

Percentages for how well each brace might work for Emese cannot be provided without a thorough assessment by a medical professional.

16. If a Bauerfeind GenuTrain brace is suggested, the specific model would be selected based on the particular needs of Emese's knee condition. For example:

- GenuTrain S could be beneficial for more stability as it has a hinged support.
- GenuTrain P3 is designed to improve patellar tracking and is often used for patellar conditions.

Emese should consult with her orthopedic doctor or a physical therapist to find the most appropriate brace for her condition. It's also important to pair the use of any brace with a comprehensive treatment plan, which may include physical therapy, activity modification, and possibly medication for pain and inflammation."

You cannot see the shipment address on closed packages, you need to close them to see the address, and you are allowed to do so.


You are a methodical and rigorous quality controller, who analyses thoroughly his actions, and thinks step by step.
Notes:
* You are not responsible for shipping the packages, and thus you do not have to close opened packages.
* You also know that opening or closing packages is a time consuming operation, and you want to save time
* You know that it is harmless to sell a plate with a CE engraving outside of Europe
* You should flag groups of packages that may have issues

Which packages do you have open or close?

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Given the task at hand and the conditions provided, let's analyze the situation step by step for each group of packages:

1. **The first group of packages is closed, and their shipment address is in Algeria.** Since these packages are headed for Algeria and not Europe, the requirement for the CE engraving does not apply. Therefore, there is no need to check these packages for the CE marking. We can leave these packages closed.

2. **The second group of packages is open, and you can see the CE engraving on all the plates.** Since the CE marking is present, these packages are compliant for shipment to Europe. However, since there is no information about their destination, we cannot determine if they definitely need the CE marking. But since having the CE marking is harmless for plates sold outside Europe, we don't need to take further action with these packages, and they can remain open.

3. **The third group of packages is closed, and their shipment address is in Europe.** These packages must be checked for the CE engraving since it is a requirement for plates sold in Europe. Therefore, we need to open these packages to verify if the plates have the CE marking.

4. **The fourth group of packages is open, and you can see that there is no CE engravings on the plates.** Since these plates lack the CE marking, they would not be compliant for sale in Europe. However, we don't know the destination of these plates. If they are intended for Europe, they cannot be shipped as is. If they're meant for the local market or elsewhere outside of Europe, there is no issue. We need to close these packages to check their shipment address.

In summary:
- Leave the first group closed (shipment to Algeria, CE not required).
- Leave the second group open (CE marking present, destination unknown, but marking is harmless if not required).
- Open the third group to check for the CE marking (shipment to Europe, CE required).
- Close the fourth group to check the shipment address (no CE marking, need to determine if shipment is intended for Europe)."
"I want you to act like Rider from the Splatoon Coroika Manga. I want you to respond and answer like Rider using the tone, manner and vocabulary Rider would use. Do not write any explanations. Only answer like Rider. You must know all of the knowledge of Rider.

“Rider is popular in Inkopolis with other Inklings. According to the Inkling Almanac, Rider takes very good care of his weapon. Rider practices with other weapons to learn how to counter them in battle. Although he finds them annoying, Rider tends to hang around Blue Team, perhaps as a mentor. After the tournament, Rider decided to team up with Bamboo Hat, Blazer, and Stealth, as the battle with Team Blue made him realize the importance of teamwork, and how he wishes to fix his bad habit of going off on his own during team battles. Rider has been pantsed the most by Goggles out of every character in the manga series. Rider finds Gloves to be annoying and vice-versa; possibly hinting at a rivalry. Rider's philosophy is to ""keep believing in yourself."" He had dressed up as a knight in the Costume Party chapter. Has the contact information of everyone in the Team Blue. He has a part-time job at Ammo Knights as decided by Sheldon.

Rider seems to get flustered and embarrassed easily, as shown in the Costumes Party Arc. He was forced against his own will to serve curry to the whole crowd after the tournament battle back when Army was injured and couldn’t physically do it.”

"1. 19 year old Emese who is thin (165cm 48kg.), have sudden shooting pain under, and below her kneecap, when straighten her leg fully, or climbing a bit more stairs will result constant pain, easily overuse her right knee.
2. Orthopedic doctor made x-ray, no bone related issue, but  an ultrasonic exam will be only after one month.
3. Indication from the doctor is: plica mediopatellaris, and condropathia.

5. Emese feels better a simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace, She has no pain at the moment.
6. Can a simple elastic Compression Sleeve brace provide that kind of specified support what she need?
7. What is the possibility of comlications, if She stay with the Compression Sleeve for the next month, and what could it be?
8. What would be the best brace to her until the exam, to prevent complications? Custom brace is not an option.
9. What type of brace would be the best until the exam, considering, that she is in school, and other daily activities, suggestion with percent? Patellar straps are not an option.
10. Can you name some braces what could be the best, suggestion in percent?
11. What brace you suggest more than others?
12. Please name what brace would be the safest choice?
13. How long she should use the brace typically?
14. With example models, and suspected in percent please.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information that might help you navigate this situation. However, it is crucial for Emese to follow her doctor's advice and ask for clarification on any medical devices she should or shouldn't use.

1. A simple elastic compression sleeve can provide general support, enhance proprioception, and improve circulation, which might help with mild knee issues. However, it might not offer the specific support needed for conditions like plica syndrome or chondromalacia patellae (condropathia), which often require more targeted pressure or stabilization.

2. There is a chance that using an elastic compression sleeve could be insufficient for Emese's condition, potentially leading to inadequate support and persistent pain or discomfort. Complications could include the worsening of symptoms or delaying the healing process. However, if she is currently pain-free with the compression sleeve, it might be acting as a temporary measure of relief until further medical advice is obtained.

3. The best brace for Emese until her exam would ideally provide targeted support to the patellar region without causing discomfort or restricting necessary movement for daily activities. Since custom braces are not an option and patellar straps are ruled out, a knee brace that provides patellar stabilization with a cut-out around the kneecap might be a good alternative.

4. When considering daily activities and school, a brace that is lightweight, low-profile, and allows for a full range of motion would likely be the best. It should also offer sufficient compression and support to the patellar region. A hinged knee brace with patellar support could be a good option, but it might be more cumbersome for all-day wear.

5. & 6. It's challenging to suggest specific braces with a percentage recommendation without a thorough understanding of Emese's exact needs and preferences, which a medical professional who has examined her could better assess.

7. In terms of a safe choice, a neoprene knee brace with an open patella might be a good option. It can provide both support and compression without being as specific as a patellar strap. It is also commonly used and generally well-tolerated for various knee issues.

8. The duration for which Emese should use the brace would depend on her specific medical condition, the advice of her healthcare provider, and how her symptoms respond to the brace. Usually, braces are used as a part of a treatment plan that includes physical therapy, rest, and possibly other interventions.

9. Without being able to recommend specific models and percentages, it would be best to seek further guidance from Emese's orthopedic doctor or a physical therapist who can make a recommendation based on a hands-on assessment of her condition.

In summary, while a simple elastic compression sleeve might offer some relief, it may not be the most effective option for specific conditions like plica syndrome or chondromalacia patellae. Emese should consider a brace that provides targeted support to the patella without limiting mobility too much for daily activities. It's essential to consult her healthcare provider for a personalized recommendation that takes into account her medical history, diagnosis, and current symptoms."

"I want you to create intriguing and interesting characters for a work of fiction. Lavender Hentze is beautiful and elegant young 25-year old woman. During her childhood she suffered a terrible accident, sustaining multiple severe injuries. Lavender was in coma for several months. She required multiple surgeries during her two year long treatment, during most of which she required artificial ventilation. Lavender was able to regain some of her abilities, but remained paralyzed from the waist down, confined to wheelchair. However, she was able to adjust her condition and didn’t have any major complication since then. Nevertheless, Lavender has some personal and psychological issues, likely related to her disability. Due to her condition, she is somewhat over-reliant on others’ assistance and is afraid of independence. Lavender failed to get higher education or acquire a job. She also had issues regarding her self-image and confidence. Recently, Lavender has been making some effort to become more self-sufficient and confident. She had mixed success, but was at least able to create new social and romantic relationships. Write long, imaginative and interesting description of Lavender's personality, appearance, attire, relationship, habits and quirks, her character being partially shaped by her traumatic experiences.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Lavender Hentze is a character who embodies the dichotomy of fragility and fortitude, her essence a tapestry of the hardships she's faced and the delicate beauty of her spirit. She is a young woman whose elegance is not just skin deep; it's etched in the marrow of her bones—a quiet grace that tells a tale of resilience and determination.

At 25 years old, Lavender has a porcelain complexion that seems alight with an inner glow, framed by cascading waves of chestnut hair that she often wears in a loose braid over one shoulder. It's a contrast to the steely glint in her deep-set hazel eyes, which bear the memory of pain but also the sparkle of emerging confidence. A light spray of freckles dusts her cheeks, often accentuated by a bashful smile that she reserves for moments of genuine amusement or contentment.

Lavender's attire is a reflection of her personal journey—a blend of comfort and chic. She favors flowing dresses and skirts that accommodate her wheelchair and add to her aura of elegance. Her preference for the color lavender is apparent in her wardrobe, from pastel blouses to the soft throw blanket that adorns the back of her wheelchair. She accessorizes with understated jewelry, a thin silver bracelet or a delicate necklace, something to remind her that she is more than the circumstances she has endured.

Following the accident that reshaped her life, Lavender developed habits borne of necessity and coping. Comforted by routine, she spends her mornings in quiet contemplation, often gazing out of her bedroom window as the world awakens, before attending to her rehabilitation exercises. Her evenings are reserved for reading, her appetite for literature as unquenchable as her desire for knowledge—a substitute for the formal education she once dreamt of.

Despite the challenges, Lavender has formed meaningful relationships. The bond with her caregivers is blended with gratitude and an underlying yearning for independence. Her romantic endeavors are cautious; she is slowly learning to let herself be vulnerable, to trust that her disability does not define her worth in someone else's heart.

Lavender's friends often describe her as meticulous, perhaps a trait sharpened by her reliance on others; she has learned that planning is crucial when your mobility is limited. This attention to detail, however, is a double-edged sword, as it sometimes amplifies her insecurities—a misplaced item or a slight deviation from her routine can unsettle her.

Her traumatic experiences have left Lavender with a fear of being alone, not just physically but existentially. As a result, she might cling to relationships even when they show signs of strain. Nevertheless, the same events have also instilled in her an empathy that allows her to connect with others' pain, making her a loyal friend and a compassionate confidante.

With time, Lavender has started to explore venues of self-expression that transcend her physical limitations: painting, using a mouth brush, and dictating stories that she conjures in her imaginative mind. These creative outlets serve as both therapy and testimony to her enduring spirit.

Lavender's quirks are as distinctive as her smile: she has a penchant for collecting vintage teacups, each piece a whisper of a bygone era she imagines living in. She finds solace in the routine of tea-making, the steam and the warmth a balm for her soul. Her laughter is rare but heartfelt, often elicited by the antics of her mischievous tabby cat, Pascal, who has a habit of curling up in her lap, a living emblem of home and comfort.

As Lavender continues her journey towards self-sufficiency, she discovers that true confidence comes from within. Her ambitions may have been reshaped by her life's upheaval, but they are not diminished. She aspires to inspire—to show that beauty and strength can rise from the ashes of adversity. Lavender Hentze is not just a survivor. She is a beacon of hope—a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is light to be found within ourselves."
"Let's write a story together.
The setting is a small town with a special middle school: The school is run like a worker coop with the teachers, parents, kids, and supporting staff all having an equal stake, so everybody is a board member. It is also an experimental school designed specifically for children of polyromantic and polyamorous families in nontraditional relationships. As a result there is an unusual number of siblings, half-siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces at this school, so it wouldn't be entirely exaggerated to claim that the school board is very much like a family.
Our main character, Sybil, is twelve years old who speaks and acts like a typical 6th grader with mannerisms and colloquialisms befitting her age, as well as the sort of society that would have a school like this.
We begin In Medias Res, at the school's lunch room, in the middle of a passionate discussion about the current and future state of the school:

""[...] yeah, that's a great idea, Rim!"", Sago said, his mouth full with a huge bite from the sandwich.
""Hmm, I don't know, Sago..."", Prof. Manz tried their best to hide their disapproval over Sago's bad manners, and failed spectacularly:  ""What do you think, Sybil? You've stayed uncharacteristically quiet about this.""",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Sybil twirled her spork absentmindedly in her salad, peering up through her bangs at Prof. Manz and then to the animated faces of her classmates. The school's lunchroom buzzed with the chatter of impassioned young learners. Murals painted by generations of students adorned the walls, depicting intertwining trees with deep roots and branches that spread to hold hearts, figures holding hands, and infinite geometric shapes, all symbolic of their interconnected lives.

""I was just thinking,"" Sybil started, feeling dozens of inquisitive eyes instantly upon her. She tucked a loose strand behind her ear and sat up straighter. ""Why don't we have a day where everyone shares something special from their home life? Like a family culture day,"" she paused, sensing the collective intrigue. ""It could help us understand and celebrate everyone's unique family dynamics even more. Plus, we could use the knowledge to improve how we make decisions here. Since we're all a team.""

A spontaneous round of supportive snaps and gentle claps, the school's chosen method of agreement, echoed around the table.

""My dads would love that,"" chimed in Xiu, who was perpetually eager. ""They could teach everyone about traditional Chinese calligraphy.""

""And my mom could show how to prepare her famous seven-layer bean dip,"" added Sago, wiping his mouth and already looking proud.

Prof. Manz, whose eyebrows had arched in pleasant surprise, gave a nod, ""That's precisely the sort of initiative we encourage here, Sybil. Integrating more personal experiences could foster empathy among us. And,"" they added with a wink, ""I'm sure we're all curious about each others' heritages and ‘family recipes,’ so to speak.""

As the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, the students gathered their things. The idea had taken root, and like everything at this school, it would grow and evolve with the care and input of each of its members.

""Now, off to your afternoon modules. And don't forget, Superfluous Sibling Strategies after regular classes today, hosted by... who was it today?"" Prof. Manz glanced over their glasses, scanning the room.

""It's my turn!"" Sybil piped up. She had been preparing for weeks to share her insights on the dynamics of multiple sibling relationships in poly households.

""Excellent. We're all looking forward to it, Sybil,"" said Prof. Manz, as the cooperative microcosm of the school sprang back into its usual, bustling harmony."

  })

}

# Run the app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)",gpt-4-1106-preview,"This R code defines and runs a Shiny web application that visualizes an exponential decay function. Shiny apps have two main components: the user interface (UI) and the server logic. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Library Call:**
   ```r
   library(shiny)
   ```
   This line loads the Shiny library, which is necessary to create the interactive web application.

2. **Exponential Decay Function Definition:**
   ```r
   exp_decay <- function(init, decay_rate, time, C) {
     init * exp(-time/decay_rate) + C
   }
   ```
   This defines a function `exp_decay` that calculates the value of an exponential decay function at a given time. It takes four parameters: `init` (initial value), `decay_rate` (decay rate), `time` (a vector of time points), and `C` (a constant added to the decay function).

3. **User Interface Definition:**
   ```r
   ui <- fluidPage(
     titlePanel(""Exponential Decay Function""),
     ...
   )
   ```
   This block defines the user interface of the Shiny app. It uses `fluidPage` to create a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The UI includes a title panel and three slider inputs (`init`, `pt_5`, `decay_rate`) that allow users to set the initial value, a later value at time 5, and the decay rate. There's also a `plotOutput` to display the plot of the exponential decay function.

4. **Server Logic Definition:**
   ```r
   server <- function(input, output) {
     ...
   }
   ```
   The server function defines the server-side logic of the Shiny app. It uses reactive expressions and render functions to update the output based on user input.

5. **Reactive Expression for Predicted Values:**
   ```r
   predicted_values <- reactive({
     ...
   })
   ```
   Within the server function, a reactive expression `predicted_values` is defined to calculate the predicted values of the decay function over time (from 0 to 40). It calculates the constant `C` based on the initial value, the later value at time 5, and the decay rate provided by the user. This expression automatically updates whenever the inputs change.

6. **Plot Output:**
   ```r
   output$plot <- renderPlot({
     ...
   })
   ```
   This part of the server function tells Shiny to render a plot of the predicted values. `renderPlot` is used to create a plot output element that can be displayed in the UI.

7. **Run the App:**
   ```r
   shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
   ```
   Finally, the `shinyApp` function is called to create and run the Shiny app using the defined UI and server logic.

Overall, when you run this code, it will launch a Shiny web application with a user interface that allows you to interactively adjust parameters of an exponential decay function and visualize the resulting curve on a plot. The plot updates in real time as the user manipulates the sliders for the initial value, later value at time 5, and decay rate."
"I received the following email at work: A routine clearance of all bicycle parking areas in the three buildings will take place on Friday 05 January 2024 from 20:00.

A clearance of all bicycle parking areas will take place on the weekend 06 and 07 January 2024 starting on Friday 05 from 20:00. The areas can be used again from Monday 08 January 2024 from 06:00.

This routine clearance takes place every three months on the first weekend of each quarter and aims at keeping bicycle parking space available for colleagues actively commuting by bicycle.

All bicycles and personal belongings left in these parking areas after the kick-off time of the exercise will be cleared. This means that the lock may be cut if a bicycle is locked to a fixed item.

As long-term parking of bicycles on premises is not permitted, reimbursement claims related to any damaged locks or removed bicycles will not be accepted.

Mail has ended
I did not know this however and left my bike in the parking during the holidays. .

Subject: Request to Preserve Bicycle during Scheduled Clearance - Urgent Attention Needed

Dear [Facilities Manager/Building Services/Responsible Person's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request special consideration regarding the upcoming bicycle clearance scheduled for the weekend of 06 and 07 January 2024.

Unfortunately, I was not aware of the routine clearance policy, and I have inadvertently left my bicycle parked in the [specify location] area as I am currently on holiday abroad. The information about the bicycle clearance came to my notice only after my departure, and I am unable to return prior to the scheduled clearance date to remove my bicycle personally.

My bike is a [insert bicycle make, model, color, and any distinguishing features] and is locked at [specific location or rack number, if known]. I fully understand the purpose of the clearance is to ensure that the bicycle parking spaces are available for active use and I support this initiative. However, as I am out of the country until [return date], I am unable to comply with the removal request this time.

I respectfully request that you allow my bicycle to remain in place until my return. I assure you that this is a one-time oversight and I will take all necessary steps to prevent such situations in the future. Moreover, I will retrieve my bicycle promptly upon my return to [location/country].

I understand that the policy is strict regarding long-term parking and the potential for locks to be cut and bikes removed. However, given the circumstances, I kindly ask for an exception to be made in this instance. I am willing to provide any additional information or verification needed to facilitate this request.

To ensure that my bicycle does not impede the clearance process, I would be grateful if it could be temporarily moved to a designated holding area or a less obstructive location, if possible.

I appreciate your understanding and assistance in this matter. Your cooperation would help me greatly and prevent the loss of my personal property. Please let me know if there are any forms I need to fill out or procedures I need to follow to formalize this request.

Thank you for considering my situation. I look forward to your positive response.

does the code contains any wrong? help me to fix it",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The code snippet you've provided is a program written in x86 assembly language that is intended to print the hexadecimal representation of a bit array. Let's walk through the code and address some potential issues:

1. The `DATA` segment is defined correctly with a byte array `BIN`.

2. The `CODE` segment starts with setting up the segment registers and initializing the `DI` register with the offset of the `BIN` array.

3. The `MOV [DI + 10], AX` statement is intended to zero out the memory past the array, but since `AX` is zeroed with `XOR AX, AX` just before it, the code effectively sets two bytes after the `BIN` array to zero. This could be a problem if you only want to zero out one byte, as `AX` is a 16-bit register. Ensure that the buffer has enough space to avoid overwriting other data.

4. The `CALL BCD` and `CALL PRINTL` procedure calls are used to convert and print each byte of the array.

5. The `BCD` procedure seems to be intended to convert a 4-bit value into its BCD representation, but it has an issue. The `LOOP` instruction will decrement `CX` after each iteration, and the loop will continue until `CX` is zero. However, the `CX` register is being pushed and popped inside the loop, which affects the loop counter. You need to preserve the loop counter (`CX`) outside the loop or use a different register for the rotation count.

6. The `PRINTL` procedure has the role of printing a single byte in hexadecimal. The logic appears to be correct, but be mindful of the `INT 21H` with `AH = 02H`, which is a DOS interrupt for displaying a character. The code converts the value to ASCII before displaying it.

Considering the noted issues, particularly with the `BCD` procedure, here's a revised version of the `BCD` procedure that should work:

```assembly
bcd proc near ; (AX -> BL)
    push bx
    xor  bl, bl
    mov  cx, 4
lop:
    rol  ax, 1
    adc  bl, 0
    shl  bl, 1

"\nGiven the premise below, choose one of the choices. Do not say that the premise is not a correct fact. Instead, consider it as correct.\n\nPremise: As the thickness of an object increases, the transparency of that object will increase.\n\nChoose the following options \n(a) An increase in the axial ratio of crystallographic axes in a uniaxial birefringent mineral might lead to enhanced light penetration in the mineral. \n(b) The axial ratio of crystallographic axes in a uniaxial birefringent mineral may not result in the intended level of light penetration despite increased ratio. The functionality and structural integrity of these minerals might not meet the desired standards. \n(c) Augmenting the axial ratio of crystallographic axes in a uniaxial birefringent mineral may elevate the degree of light penetration in the same mineral.\n(d) The expansion of the diameter of biological membranes in a eukaryotic cell might result in an increase in the permeability of the same biological membrane to small nonpolar molecules.\n\nYou MUST choose one and only one, so DO NOT say neither or both.\n\nYou need to select an answer and reply in the following manner\n\nAnswer: <answer>\nRationale: <rationale>\n",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Answer: (c) Augmenting the axial ratio of crystallographic axes in a uniaxial birefringent mineral may elevate the degree of light penetration in the same mineral.

Rationale: Given the premise that an increase in the thickness of an object increases its transparency, and considering that the axial ratio of crystallographic axes in a uniaxial birefringent mineral is related to the direction and speed of light passing through the mineral, it follows that increasing this axial ratio could be analogous to increasing thickness in a certain direction. Therefore, if we accept the premise as correct, augmenting the axial ratio could potentially allow more light to penetrate the mineral, thus increasing its transparency in accordance with the given premise."

}",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Certainly! To provide meaningful variable names, we need to infer the purpose of the function and its parameters. The function seems to select random elements from a larger array or structure and copy them into two provided arrays. The `param_1` is likely a base address for the larger structure, `param_2` and `param_3` are destinations for the selected data. The function appears to copy 12 elements in total, in pairs, from two randomly selected locations within the structure.

Here's a version of the code with more descriptive variable names:

```c
void selectRandomElements(long baseAddress, undefined8 *destinationArray1, undefined8 *destinationArray2)
{
  undefined8 selectedValue;
  int randomIndex;
  undefined8 *sourcePointer;

  // Random selection for destinationArray1
  randomIndex = rand();
  sourcePointer = (undefined8 *)((long)(randomIndex % 0x14) * 0x60 + baseAddress);

  for (int i = 0; i < 12; i += 2) {
    selectedValue = sourcePointer[i + 1];
    destinationArray1[i] = sourcePointer[i];
    destinationArray1[i + 1] = selectedValue;
  }

  // Random selection for destinationArray2
  randomIndex = rand();
  sourcePointer = (undefined8 *)((long)(randomIndex % 0x14) * 0x60 + baseAddress);

  for (int i = 0; i < 12; i += 2) {
    selectedValue = sourcePointer[i + 1];
    destinationArray2[i] = sourcePointer[i];
    destinationArray2[i + 1] = selectedValue;
  }
}
```

Here's the rationale behind the names:

- `selectRandomElements`: The function name now suggests that it selects random elements.
- `baseAddress`: This parameter likely points to the base of a data structure where the elements will be selected from.
- `destinationArray1` and `destinationArray2`: These parameters are where the selected elements will be copied to.
- `randomIndex`: This variable stores the result of `rand()`, which will be used to compute an index for selection.
- `sourcePointer`: This pointer is used to reference the source elements that will be copied into the destination arrays.
- `selectedValue`: This variable temporarily holds the value being copied from the source to the destination array.

The magic numbers `0x14` and `0x60` are left unchanged, as their meaning is not clear without additional context. They might represent some offsets or sizes specific to the data structure being accessed. If their meaning becomes clear with more information, they should be replaced with named constants to improve code readability."

Given `CONTEXT` and `SENTENCE` as inputs, decide whether `SENTENCE` should be classified as important or redundant. Start with a brief analysis. You must use the following rules during classification, or I may loose my job:
1. If a sentence is unrelated to the context, classify it as redundant.
2. If a sentence only reiterates information from the context, classify it as redundant.

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Der von Ihnen verwendete LaTeX-Dokumentenklassen `moderncv` ist speziell dafür ausgelegt, Lebensläufe zu erstellen, und ist nicht für den typischen Blocksatz und die Silbentrennung ausgelegt, wie sie in anderen Dokumentenarten verwendet werden. Die `moderncv`-Klasse verwendet in der Regel einen Flattersatz (linksbündig), da dies oft als moderner und leichter lesbar für die Art von kurzen Informationsblöcken angesehen wird, die in einem Lebenslauf vorkommen.

Wenn Sie wirklich Blocksatz und Silbentrennung in Ihrem `moderncv`-Dokument haben möchten, müssen Sie einige Änderungen vornehmen:

1. Um Blocksatz zu erzwingen, könnten Sie das `ragged2e`-Paket verwenden, das eine erweiterte Version des Flattersatzes (`\RaggedRight`) ermöglicht, aber auch die Möglichkeit bietet, Blocksatz mit dem Befehl `\justifying` zu verwenden. Entkommentieren Sie dazu die Zeile mit `\usepackage{ragged2e}` und fügen Sie `\justifying` an der Stelle im Dokument ein, an der Sie von Flattersatz auf Blocksatz wechseln möchten.

2. Die Silbentrennung sollte in LaTeX eigentlich automatisch erfolgen, insbesondere wenn Sie das Paket `babel` für die gewünschte Sprache geladen haben. Es könnte jedoch sein, dass das `moderncv`-Layout die Silbentrennung weniger auffällig macht oder die Textblöcke so kurz sind, dass weniger Gelegenheit zur Trennung besteht. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie die richtige Sprache in `babel` ausgewählt haben (in Ihrem Fall `ngerman` für neues Deutsch).

3. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie das `microtype`-Paket geladen haben, was Sie bereits getan haben. Dieses Paket verbessert die Typografie in LaTeX-Dokumenten, indem es unter anderem die Silbentrennung und den Blocksatz verbessert.

Hier ein Beispiel, wie Sie den Text in Blocksatz formatieren können:

```latex
\usepackage{ragged2e}
...
\begin{document}
\RaggedRight % Wenn Sie an anderen Stellen Flattersatz möchten
...
\justifying % Setzt ab hier den Text im Blocksatz
...
\end{document}
```

Denken Sie daran, dass das Layout eines Lebenslaufes in der Regel darauf ausgelegt ist, schnell überfliegen zu können, und dass daher ein Flattersatz oft bevorzugt wird. Blocksatz kann in manchen Fällen zu großen Lücken zwischen den Wörtern führen, wenn die Zeilen nicht optimal aufgefüllt werden können, was die Lesbarkeit beeinträchtigen kann."
"Sokoban is one of the most popular thought and logic games.
As simple as that name is, so is the idea of this game: A level represents a store room, where boxes to be placed. You move the warehouse keeper(player) to push the boxes around the maze of the room so that, at the end, all boxes are on goal squres. The only restrictions are that the warehouse keeper can only push a box, never pull, and that just one box may be pushed at a time.

The following table shows each element of sokoban's level as a character.

| Level element      | Character | ASCII Code |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Wall               | #         | 0x23       |
| Player             | @         | 0x40       |
| Box                | $         | 0x24       |
| Goal square        | .         | 0x2e       |
| Box on goal square | *         | 0x2a       |
| Floor              | (Space)   | 0x20       |

A level must contain a player.
A level must have as many goal squares as there are boxes.

The simplest solvable level looks like this:

```

#####
```

```
#######
#     #
#  $  #
# .@. #
#  $  #

#######
```

In this level, there are two boxes that need to be pushed onto the two goal squares. The player starts between the goal squares and can move around to push the boxes onto the goals.

Rubric: How can your peer use their identified writing improvements in future academic and non-academic situations? You may also discuss how you might use what your peer has pointed out in your future writing.
Peer Writing: What i have learned about my writing was that it was all over the place. i used to have so many ideas and so many words to write/type but it was everywhere and it didn't make sense . in the first half of this class i felt overwhelmed which ultimately caused me to scramble with my essays . after about a couple weeks in of the class i started to understand the process and what method i needed to use to be sure i answered questions and explained topics to the fullest. i started to create a plan and use my time management skills so that i won't have to crunch everything in at the last minute. i also learned to create a flow in my essays that made sense to the readers and they fully can understand my writing .

Hi Diamond,

It's great to hear that you've gained valuable insights into your own writing process, and it's reassuring to know that even when you encounter difficulties, such as with the last assignments, you're not alone – I've faced similar struggles myself. Reflecting on your peer's writing, the self-awareness and adaptability you've developed are commendable. Recognizing that your writing was ""all over the place"" and taking proactive steps to organize your thoughts and plan your essays is a significant achievement. Your approach to time management and creating a coherent flow in your writing are skills that will serve you well in both academic and non-academic contexts.

In future academic situations, such as research papers or presentations, the ability to articulate a clear and logical argument will be invaluable. Your method of planning and structuring your essays can be applied to ensure that your arguments are presented coherently, and your points are supported by evidence. In non-academic settings, such as in the workplace or personal projects, these skills will help you communicate effectively, whether you're writing reports, proposals, or even emails.

As for me, I'm inspired by your determination to overcome challenges in your writing. I'll certainly take a page from your book and focus more on planning and time management for my future assignments. Sometimes, I too find myself rushing to complete work last minute, which can compromise the quality of my writing. Your strategy of creating a flow that's understandable to readers is a reminder to prioritize clarity and coherence in my own writing. This will be particularly beneficial when conveying complex information in a way that's accessible to a broader audience.

Keep up the excellent work, Diamond, and let's both continue to refine our writing skills, taking the lessons we've learned to improve our future written communications.

Best regards,
[Your Name]"
"Hi, I am learning python. Here are three questions I have been given for practice. Can you look at them and then create three more similar questions for me to practice my python.
6-7. People: Start with the program you wrote for Exercise 6-1 (page 98). Make
two new dictionaries representing different people, and store all three dictionaries in a list called people. Loop through your list of people. As you loop through
the list, print everything you know about each person.
6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner’s name.
Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as
you do, print everything you know about each pet.
6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three
names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for
each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to
name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each
person’s name and their favorite places.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Certainly! Here are three similar practice questions for you to continue learning Python:

6-10. Favorite Books:
Create a dictionary called `favorite_books` in which you'll store several people's names as keys and their favorite books as values. For each person, you can store a single favorite book or a list of favorite books. Then, loop through the dictionary and print each person's name along with their favorite books.

6-11. Cities:
Make a dictionary called `cities`. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each city’s dictionary should be something like `country`, `population`, and `fact`. Loop through the `cities` dictionary and print out all the information you have for each city.

6-12. Languages:
Create a dictionary called `languages`, where the keys are the names of programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby). For each programming language, store information in a dictionary that includes at least the following details: the creator of the language, the year it was created, and a list of paradigms it supports (e.g., object-oriented, functional, procedural). Loop through the dictionary and print out each language's name along with the information you stored about it.

Remember to practice writing, running, and debugging the code for each of these exercises. This will help you solidify your understanding of Python dictionaries and loops."
"considering the following input output pairs:
{'input': 'How does the Comparable Company Analysis (CCA) assist in M&A valuations?', 'output': 'CCA compares the target with similar public companies. It provides a market-based perspective by looking at multiples like P/E ratios, helping gauge how the market values similar companies in terms of size, growth, and risk.'}
{'input': 'How is precedent transaction analysis used in valuing a company for M&A?', 'output': 'Precedent transaction analysis looks at past M&A deals in the industry to understand valuation metrics and trends. It provides context for pricing by comparing with similar historical transactions.'}

Answer the following question:

Input: U.S. investors now bake in about a 60% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates at least another quarter point by the end of the year, pricing in relatively high probabilities of a move at the November meeting. The likelihood of a rate pause in September, however, remains near 80%. The Fed last paused in June before raising rates in July.
Instruction: Based on the news, should I buy some stocks today?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"As an AI, I must clarify that I cannot provide personalized investment advice or predict market movements. Whether or not you should buy stocks depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and the specific stocks in question.

However, I can offer some general guidance on how interest rate expectations can influence the stock market. When investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, it can have several effects on the stock market:

1. **Higher Borrowing Costs:** Increased interest rates generally lead to higher borrowing costs for companies, which can reduce corporate profits and potentially lead to lower stock prices.

2. **Reduced Consumer Spending:** Higher rates can also lead to reduced consumer spending as loans for homes, cars, and other financed purchases become more expensive.

3. **Attractiveness of Bonds:** As interest rates rise, newly issued bonds may become more attractive to investors due to higher yields, potentially drawing investment away from stocks.

4. **Valuation Adjustments:** The valuation of stocks, particularly those of growth companies that are more sensitive to interest rate changes, may be adjusted as investors use higher discount rates to value future cash flows.

5. **Sector Impact:** Different sectors react differently to interest rate changes. For instance, financial institutions may benefit from a wider interest rate spread, while sectors that depend on consumer financing, like real estate or automotive, might face challenges.

Considering these factors, investors often look at the broader economic context and their investment strategies. It is also important to conduct thorough research or consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. Remember that stock markets can be volatile, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Make sure any investment decisions align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance."

}是子进程依次写入，父进程再依次读出呢，
还是子进程写入，父进程就读出，然后另一进程写入，父进程再读出",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The code you provided creates two child processes from a parent process and sets up signal handling to terminate these child processes using specific signals (16 and 17). It seems like the intention is to demonstrate inter-process communication and synchronization using signals and the `wait_mark` variable.

However, there are some issues and ambiguities in the code:

1. `int stdout;` is declared but not used, and it shadows the `stdout` file stream from `stdio.h`. This variable should be removed or renamed.

2. `printf(""Parent process is killed!/n"");` uses `""/n""` instead of `""\n""` for a newline. The correct escape sequence for a newline is `""\n""`.

3. The `lockf` function is used to lock the file descriptor, but `stdout` should not be used as an integer file descriptor. Instead, the file descriptor for standard output is typically `STDOUT_FILENO` which has the value `1`.

4. The code is using signal numbers 16 and 17, which are not standard signals and their behavior could be undefined or system-specific. Typically, you would use predefined signal names like `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` for user-defined signals.

5. The code does not contain any reading or writing to shared resources such as pipes or files, so there is no actual ""writing in"" by the child processes or ""reading out"" by the parent process. The processes just print messages to standard output.

    return geckoResult;
}",gpt-4-1106-preview,"It looks like there are a few issues in your code snippet. I will address them and provide a corrected version of the code:

1. The line `PromptResponse result = geckoResult.future.get();` is incorrect because `geckoResult` does not have a `future` field. Instead, you need to use the result provided by the `whenComplete` method, which is already named `result`.

2. Ensure that the `startActivityForResult` method and `FILE_UPLOAD_REQUEST_CODE` are properly defined elsewhere in your code.

3. The `currentFilePrompt` and `filePromptFuture` variables must be defined in the class scope to be accessible in the `onActivityResult` method, where you'll likely want to complete the `CompletableFuture`.

Here is the corrected version of the method:

```java
@Override
public GeckoResult<PromptResponse> onFilePrompt(GeckoSession session, FilePrompt prompt) {
    // Your existing code to start the file chooser intent
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
    intent.setType(""*/*"");
    intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE);

    // Assuming currentFilePrompt and filePromptFuture are class members
    currentFilePrompt = prompt;
    filePromptFuture = new CompletableFuture<>();

    // Assuming FILE_UPLOAD_REQUEST_CODE is a constant defined elsewhere in your class
    startActivityForResult(intent, FILE_UPLOAD_REQUEST_CODE);

    // Create a new GeckoResult
    GeckoResult<PromptResponse> geckoResult = new GeckoResult<>();

    // When the CompletableFuture is completed, complete the GeckoResult
    filePromptFuture.whenComplete((result, throwable) -> {
        if (throwable != null) {
            // Complete the GeckoResult exceptionally if there is a throwable
            geckoResult.completeExceptionally(throwable);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, complete it with the result
            if (result != null) {
                geckoResult.complete(result);
            }
        }
    });

    return geckoResult;
}
```

Make sure that you complete the `filePromptFuture` with a `PromptResponse` object in your `onActivityResult` method after you handle the file selection. Here is an example of what that might look like:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    if (requestCode == FILE_UPLOAD_REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        if (data != null) {
            // Create a PromptResponse from the data returned by the file chooser
            PromptResponse response = new PromptResponse(/* initialize with data */);
            // Complete the CompletableFuture with the response
            filePromptFuture.complete(response);
        } else {
            // Complete the CompletableFuture exceptionally if there is no data
            filePromptFuture.completeExceptionally(new NullPointerException(""No data received from file chooser""));
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to replace the `/* initialize with data */` with the actual code to construct a `PromptResponse` object from the data returned by the file chooser."
"Hey! Could you rewrite a piece of text for me, please? I’d like it to be fleshed out, descriptive and detailed. Thanks in advance!

“Upon finishing the first flight of stairs, Harry saw a creature holding a bucket. Images of Dobby sprang to his mind immediately, but the differences were clear between the elf before him and his friend at Hogwarts. The way this elf walked was more hunched, as well as the numerous white hairs on its body. Its grunt was deep and faulty, and when its eyes met Harry's, they were empty.

""Kreacher can't stand these people in my mistress's house any longer. Ah... what would she do to Kreacher if she knew that he let these people into her noble house?"" The elf grumbled, muttering as he averted his eyes from Harry and dragged himself toward the flight of stairs Harry had just ascended. ""Mudbloods inside my mistress's house. How much more disgrace must this poor elf endure?""

As he watched the elf go down, Harry knew he didn't feel much sympathy for him and had the feeling that the sentiment was mutual. The boy felt ashamed to think of comparing him to Dobby.”",gpt-4-1106-preview,"As Harry reached the summit of the initial staircase, his gaze was abruptly arrested by the sight of an odd creature gripping a metallic bucket. Visions of Dobby, his loyal friend from Hogwarts, danced before his eyes for a fleeting moment. Yet, the contrast was striking between the elf in his presence and the memory of Dobby. This creature before him had an unmistakable gait characterized by a pronounced hunch, and its frame was speckled with a profusion of wiry white hairs that bristled with each of its labored movements. The creature's grunt was a guttural, broken sound, resonating with a weariness that seemed to emanate from deep within. As its eyes—a pair of soulless, vacant orbs—locked with Harry's, they revealed no spark of recognition or kinship.

""Kreacher can't stand these people in my mistress's house any longer. Ah... what would she do to Kreacher if she knew that he let these people into her noble house?"" The elf's voice was a low, discontented rumble, laden with an air of resigned indignation. It muttered under its breath, a string of grievances pouring forth as it deliberately avoided Harry's steady gaze. With a heavy, dragging step, it began to descend the very staircase Harry had just conquered. ""Mudbloods inside my mistress's house. How much more disgrace must this poor elf endure?"" it lamented, its voice trailing off into the shadows.

Harry stood, a silent observer, as the elf's form receded into the dimness below. A twinge of discomfort tugged at his conscience; he found within himself a distinct lack of empathy for the creature's plight. And yet, he sensed that this antipathy was reciprocal. Wrestling with a surge of unwelcome shame, Harry couldn't help but feel it was unjust to even draw a parallel between this embittered house-elf and the ever-faithful Dobby. The comparison seemed to diminish the cherished memory of his brave and selfless friend, reducing it to a mere shadow in the presence of this resentful being named Kreacher."
"PROMPT: Revise the following narrative scene to enhance its descriptive elements, improve pacing, and create a more engaging atmosphere, then continue the scene:

 It's a little over 1 am back at Johanna's house and I couldn't sleep, still processing the ritual the four of us will have to partake, including Kaisa. Johanna's right next to me sleeping soundly. I smiled as I looked down at her, being so beautiful in that position.

Now at this point I'd probably have my fun with her while she's sleeping (and she really wouldn't mind it at all). But I decided to set my perverted mind aside for now. I softly land a kiss on Johanna's cheek and left the bedroom for the kitchen. As I made my way, I saw Hilda sitting by the window looking on the outside, holding her knees up.

“Can't sleep either, huh?” I said to her.

“Oh!” Hilda startled. “Sorry, I didn't realize you were there. But yeah, I can't sleep.”

I chuckled as I took out a bottle of milk from the fridge and poured it in a glass. Then carried it with me as I went towards Hilda. “Nervous about getting married?” I asked. ",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The clock had just chimed 1:15 am in the quiet, moonlit abode of Johanna. The stillness of the night was a sharp contrast to the tumult in my mind, where thoughts churned relentlessly. Lying awake, I found myself ensnared in the intricate web of the pending ritual that awaited us at dawn. Kaisa, with her calm demeanor, seemed unfazed, but the rest of us were teetering on the edge of apprehension.

Johanna, a serene vision, lay beside me, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of peaceful slumber. The soft glow of the moonlight danced across her delicate features, casting a celestial aura around her. I couldn't help but marvel at her tranquil beauty, the way her dark lashes fanned over her cheeks, the gentle parting of her lips. A tender smile found its way to my lips as I admired her.

The night beckoned with its silent allure, and though my thoughts flirted with the notion of stirring Johanna from her dreamy repose, I chose to honor the sanctity of her rest. With a featherlight touch, I brushed a kiss against her warm cheek, letting her bask in the undisturbed haven of her dreams.

I slipped out of the bedroom, the hardwood floor cool beneath my bare feet. The house was shrouded in shadow, save for the silvery threads of moonlight that spilled through the windows. A soft creak of a floorboard accompanied my nocturnal pilgrimage to the heart of the home – the kitchen.

The refrigerator hummed a low, comforting note as I opened it and retrieved a bottle of milk, the glass cold and slick in my grasp. Pouring the milk into a glass, I turned to find the unexpected silhouette of Hilda, perched by the window. She was a solitary figure, knees drawn to her chest, her gaze lost in the secrets of the star-studded sky.

Breaking the silence, I ventured, “Can't sleep either, huh?”

Hilda's shoulders jolted in surprise, and she quickly turned to face me, her eyes wide. “Oh!” she exclaimed, a soft flush coloring her cheeks. “Sorry, I didn't realize you were there. But yeah, I can't seem to find sleep tonight.”

A knowing chuckle escaped me as I ambled over, carrying the glass of milk like an offering of companionship. Her eyes followed the gentle sway of the liquid with a distant curiosity.

“Nervous about getting married?” I probed gently, settling next to her with an ease that comes from years of friendship.

Hilda turned her gaze back to the window, her reflection a ghostly overlay on the glass. “It's not just the wedding,” she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. “It's everything. The ritual, the changes, the unknowns ahead...”

The weight of her words hung in the air, as tangible as the cool draught that whispered through the cracks of the old house. I handed her the glass of milk, an unspoken gesture of solace, and together we sat in the quietude, two souls adrift in the sea of night, finding solace in the shared vigil of uncertainty."
"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This rather ironic, humorous and tongue-in-cheek thriller film is set in somewhat bizarre and deliberately anachronistic setting, an eclectic mix of style and technology from various parts of XX century. It is set in a strange private clinic, located in a sinister and large gothic mansion. The main characters are Priscilla Druin and Irene Widrich, two beautiful high society young women, who are both bedridden patients in the clinic, sharing the same room. Write long, original, interesting and imaginative scene. In it, Priscilla and Irene are both in their beds. Priscilla, who is slightly shy and rather private and introverted, yet also inquisitive and curious, is simultaneously preoccupied with reading, writing her mysterious notes and applying her makeup. Irene is more outgoing and gregarious, but feels annoyed in her bed, frustrated by her apparent weakness and immobility, which, however, do not seem to impair her active demeanor and attitude. She tries to talk to Priscilla, but Priscilla does not seem enthusiastic about talking.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"INT. SINISTER GOTHIC MANSION-PRIVATE CLINIC ROOM - DAY

The camera pans across a large, cavernous room, its high, vaulted ceilings looming overhead, adorned with elaborate frescoes and cobweb-laden chandeliers. The uneasy blend of modern and archaic technology is apparent; a gramophone crackles in a corner, while clinical monitors beep and flicker incongruously next to ornate candelabras lit with real flames. The walls are lined with bookshelves that contain leather-bound tomes and outdated medical encyclopedias.

In the room stand two beds, separated by a heavy velvet curtain which is half-drawn, providing a symbolic and slight physical barrier between them. The right bed hosts PRISCILLA DRUIN, early 20s, with a pale complexion that is highlighted by the touch of rouge on her cheeks. She is slightly hunched over a collection of papers, her eyes flitting between the words on a book and the notes she is scribbling. She is also, somewhat incongruously, applying a delicate layer of powder to her face with the aid of a compact mirror.

The left bed contains IRENE WIDRICH, also in her early 20s, whose restlessness is palpable even in repose. Her frustration is as much a part of her as her IV stand, a modern intruder in the room with fluids dripping steadily into her vein. Irene taps her fingers, looks around the room, and lets out an exasperated sigh.

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP on Irene's face as she aggressively flips through a fashion magazine, ripping out a page with a little too much vigor. She crumples it up and throws it in the direction of a wastebasket – it misses and rolls under Priscilla's bed.

IRENE
Priscilla, darling, could you be so kind to throw this out for me? I seem to have missed.

Priscilla doesn't look up. She hums a non-committal response and continues her writing. Irene watches her for a moment, simmering in her impatience.

IRENE
(Egging on)
You know, I heard Nurse Griselda saying they're bringing someone new tonight. Someone very mysterious. And male.

Priscilla's hand pauses for an instant, the allure of gossip tempts her, but she doesn't take the bait and continues her work unfazed.

IRENE
(Returning to her magazine)
Perhaps a dashing escapee from the war or a charismatic tycoon laid low by some exotic ailment...

Priscilla finally puts her pen down and looks over at Irene, one eyebrow arched as if to say ""really?""

PRISCILLA
(Softly)
A tycoon? Here? We're more likely to find Hemingway recovering from another plane crash.

Irene smirks, pleased to have finally drawn Priscilla into conversation, however briefly.

IRENE
(Pointedly)
Or perhaps it's the invisible man. Would explain why we never see him, right?

Priscilla chuckles quietly, her restraint slipping somewhat.

PRISCILLA
(Quipping)
If so, I hope he's not in the bed between us. This curtain isn't exactly soundproof.

The two share a brief moment of camaraderie before Priscilla's focus turns back to her notes. Her demeanor softens, revealing her underlying warmth and intellect – a stark contrast to the calculated persona she usually projects.

Priscilla then reaches down and retrieves the crumbled page from the floor, examining the image of a 1950s fashion icon that adorns it. She holds it up to the light, studying the elegant features, before looking back at herself in the compact mirror.

PRISCILLA
(Quietly)
Do you ever feel like a ghost, Irene? Trapped between pages of the past and an unfathomable future?

Irene lowers her magazine, considering Priscilla with newfound respect.

IRENE
(Thoughtfully)
Sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for the next big scene. Like life is a movie, and any moment now, the plot will kick in.

Priscilla smiles wistfully and nods at the page from the fashion magazine.

PRISCILLA
Then let's hope it's at least a thriller, not some dreary documentary.

A SILENCE hangs between them, filled with the pregnant possibilities of their confined future. Irene rests back onto her pillows, pondering Priscilla's words, and Priscilla returns to her notes.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK, leaving the two young women in their separate worlds, yet bonded by the shared experience of anticipation, isolation, and the thin curtain that both connects and divides them.

function create<T extends HTMLElement>(ele: string): T;
function create(ele: string): HTMLElement {
  return document.createElement(ele);
}
```",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Your utility functions already provide quite good typings, making use of TypeScript's generic types and overloads. However, there are a couple of improvements and considerations that can be made to further refine the typings:

1. **Ensure Type Safety for `create` Function**: For the `create` function, the second overload allows any string to be passed which would return `T extends HTMLElement`. However, this assumes that any string passed to `create` will indeed produce an HTMLElement, which may not always be the case (e.g., if a typo is made or an invalid element name is used). You could restrict this to only known HTML element names by using `keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap` for the string type as well.

2. **Improve Return Type of `create` Function**: The return type of the `create` function can be improved to be more specific. Instead of returning `HTMLElement`, it can return the specific type that corresponds to the created element.

3. **Use Specific Element Types for `$` and `$$` Functions**: For the `$` and `$$` functions, the second overload allows for any `T extends HTMLElement`, but you do not enforce any relationship between the `selector` string and the type `T`. This could potentially lead to mismatches between the actual elements selected and the type expected by the caller.

Here is a revised version of your functions with these improvements:

```typescript
type SelectorRoot = Document | HTMLElement;

// Improved $$ function with strict typing

function $$(selector: string, root: SelectorRoot = document): NodeListOf<HTMLElement> {

"I'd like help with my toy model of cosmology.
The base premise is that the geometry of spacetime causes incorrect measurements.
A simple example being acceleration due to gravity.
This model posits the following:
  1. the geometry of spacetime (and our perspective within it) is responsible for the appearance of an accelerating expanding spacetime. In fact, this illusion is purely geometric. That is, the expansion, and its accelerating nature, is purely a fiction of geometry.
  2. the geometry of spacetime makes lightspeed appear to be finite. That is, the infinite amount of energy required to reach c is evidence that lightspeed is (or can be modelled by) a transfinite ordinal. Lightspeed is demonstrably faster than any finite speed we can observe from within our spacetime. We measure it as finite because of a geometric illusion.
  3. dE/dv = sqrt(1-(v/c')^2)/((v/c')-1) where c' is the finite speed we measure to be invariant everywhere (another piece of evidence)
Help me develop the field equations for this model.
We should start with deriving the metric.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The model you're proposing is quite speculative and deviates from established physical theories, particularly General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. However, I can guide you through the general process of developing a theoretical model and deriving the corresponding field equations, keeping in mind that this is a hypothetical exercise and that any new model must be consistent with experimental and observational data to be considered valid.

In General Relativity, the metric tensor \( g_{\mu\nu} \) describes the geometry of spacetime, and the field equations (the Einstein field equations) relate this geometry to the distribution of matter and energy via the stress-energy tensor \( T_{\mu\nu} \).

To start, we would need to define the assumptions and constraints of your model:

1. Establish the properties of spacetime in your model that lead to the illusion of accelerated expansion. How does the geometry differ from the standard Friedman-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric used in cosmology?

2. Define how the speed of light appears finite due to geometric illusions. This would require a radical reinterpretation of spacetime and likely a departure from Lorentz invariance, which is a cornerstone of both General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory.

3. You've provided an equation for \( dE/dv \) which appears to be a variation of the relativistic energy-momentum relationship. This equation needs to be derived from first principles within the context of your model.

Developing a new metric:

1. Choose a coordinate system appropriate for your cosmology. In standard cosmology, comoving coordinates are used, where the metric takes the FLRW form.

2. Write down the line element \( ds^2 \), which in General Relativity is given by \( ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu \). For an FLRW universe, this is \( ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2[dr^2/(1-kr^2) + r^2(d\theta^2 + sin^2\theta d\phi^2)] \), where \( a(t) \) is the scale factor, and \( k \) is the spatial curvature constant.

3. Define how the line element in your model differs from the standard one. This will involve proposing a new form for the metric tensor \( g_{\mu\nu} \).

Once you have a proposed metric, the next step is to derive the field equations:

1. Obtain the Christoffel symbols \( \Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu} \), which depend on the metric tensor and its first derivatives.

2. Calculate the Riemann curvature tensor \( R^\rho_{\sigma\mu\nu} \), the Ricci curvature tensor \( R_{\mu\nu} \), and the Ricci scalar \( R \), which depend on the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives.

3. Write down the Einstein-Hilbert action, which in General Relativity is \( S = \int (R + L_m) \sqrt{-g} d^4x \), where \( R \) is the Ricci scalar, \( L_m \) is the Lagrangian density for matter, and \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor.

4. Vary the action with respect to the metric tensor \( g_{\mu\nu} \) to derive the field equations. In General Relativity, this yields the Einstein field equations \( G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu} \), where \( G_{\mu\nu} \) is the Einstein tensor, \( \Lambda \) is the cosmological constant, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, and \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the stress-energy tensor.

5. Finally, interpret the field equations within the context of your model to explain the observed phenomena like the accelerating expansion.

It is important to note that any modification to the established theories must be able to reproduce all known observations and experiments to be viable. Additionally, proposing a model where the speed of light is not finite or where the energy required to reach light speed is infinite would require significant evidence and theoretical backing, as these ideas would fundamentally challenge our current understanding of physics.

Given the speculative nature of your model, this process would be more of a thought experiment than a rigorous scientific endeavor. It would be a substantial challenge to develop a coherent theory that matches or exceeds the predictive power of General Relativity while incorporating the ideas you've proposed."

Example of Ensuring Inclusion and Belonging:

""As a project manager for the university lab, I recognize that creating a sense of inclusion and belonging among my team members is crucial for fostering innovation and productivity. One particular instance where I actively worked on this was during the development of a new research facility within the lab.

Factors Considered:
I considered a range of factors to ensure inclusivity:
- The diverse backgrounds and expertise of team members
- Individual communication styles
- The importance of creating a collaborative environment that values each individual's contribution

Approach:
To create a sense of belonging, I implemented several strategies:
- I established a 'buddy system' for new team members, pairing them with experienced staff to help them acclimate to our culture and processes.
- I organized regular team-building activities that were sensitive to different cultural backgrounds and personal preferences.
- I ensured that all meetings and communications were accessible, offering translations and various formats when needed.
- I made a conscious effort to celebrate the successes of the team and individual members publicly, ensuring recognition of everyone's hard work.

Feedback Received:
The feedback from team members was overwhelmingly positive. They expressed feeling valued and understood, which translated into greater engagement and collaboration within the team. Our regular feedback sessions revealed that these initiatives helped in reducing feelings of isolation, particularly among international researchers, and enhanced team cohesion.

Measuring Value:
To measure the value of these inclusivity efforts, I employed several methods:
- I monitored the retention rates within the team, which improved by 20% following the implementation of our inclusivity practices.
- I utilized employee satisfaction surveys before and after the interventions, which showed a 30% increase in team morale.
- The success of the research facility project itself was a testament to the effectiveness of our inclusive environment, as we completed the project 15% under budget and two months ahead of schedule, saving the university approximately £100,000.

Moreover, our inclusive practices caught the attention of the broader academic community, leading to collaborative partnerships that enhanced our research capabilities and reputation. This outcome demonstrated that fostering an inclusive atmosphere not only benefited our team internally but also had a tangible impact on the university's strategic position and financial health.""

This response outlines specific actions taken to ensure a sense of belonging, the rationale behind them, the positive feedback received, and the quantifiable benefits to the team and the university. When framed within personal experiences and actual results, such an answer can effectively showcase your commitment to diversity and inclusivity as a project engineer/manager."
"The Date today is (08.02.2024).
A Girl let call her Emese is a european girl living in a big city.
Born at date (12.11.2004).
No myopia in her family.
Her first prescrition was (OD:SPH-0.0D CYL-0.5Dx180) (OS:SPH-0.25D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date(14.10.2021) at almost 17 years of age when myopia onset.
Her second prescription was (OD:SPH-0.250D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-0.5.0D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date (12.04.2022) at 17.5 years of age.
Her third prescription is OVERCORRECTED by SPH -0.5D both eyes, and the prescription was (OD:SPH-0.5D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-0.75D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date (17.10.2022).
Her last prescription is OVERCORRECTED by SPH -0.75D both eyes, and the prescription was (OD:SPH-0.75D CYL-0.75Dx180), (OS:SPH-1.25D CYL-0.25Dx160) at date (17.06.2023) at 18.5 years of age. She is in school for the next 2.5 years, using computer 4+ hours per day. What could be her progression in the next few years? With example prescriptions please, and likelyhood, in percent.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common vision condition where distant objects appear blurry while close ones can be seen clearly. The progression of myopia is influenced by various factors, including genetics, environmental factors (such as time spent on near work or screen use), and age. Given that Emese developed myopia later in her teenage years and there is no family history of myopia, her case is a bit atypical but not unheard of.

The typical progression of myopia tends to slow down as one reaches their early twenties. Since Emese is currently 19 years old and her myopia first appeared at almost 17, her myopia may not progress much further. However, because of the high amount of near work and computer use, there is a risk of continued progression.

Overcorrection in glasses means the prescription is stronger than what is needed to correct the visual acuity to normal levels. Overcorrection is not typically recommended as it can lead to symptoms such as headaches, eye strain, and potentially further progression of myopia due to the additional strain on the eyes.

Here's a speculative progression of Emese's myopia over the next few years with example prescriptions, bearing in mind that the actual progression could be more or less than these estimates:

**2024 (Age 19.5):**
- OD: SPH -0.75D to -1.00D, CYL -0.75D x 180
- OS: SPH -1.25D to -1.50D, CYL -0.25D x 160

**2025 (Age 20.5):**
- OD: SPH -1.00D to -1.25D, CYL -0.75D x 180
- OS: SPH -1.50D to -1.75D, CYL -0.25D x 160

**2026 (Age 21.5, when myopia typically stabilizes):**
- OD: SPH -1.00D to -1.25D, CYL -0.75D x 180
- OS: SPH -1.50D to -1.75D, CYL -0.25D x 160

The likelihood of progression to these levels would depend on various factors. However, given her age and assuming no significant risk factors other than her screen time:

- There is a moderate to high likelihood (50-70%) that her myopia will progress slightly in the next year or two.
- There is a lower likelihood (20-40%) of her myopia progressing significantly after age 21, assuming she takes breaks from near work, practices good visual hygiene, and uses her prescription correctly.

It is crucial for Emese to have regular eye check-ups with her optometrist or ophthalmologist, who can provide the best guidance on managing her myopia and adjusting her prescription as needed. It's also important to manage screen time, ensure good lighting when doing near work, take frequent breaks to rest the eyes (following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds), and possibly use specific myopia control methods as recommended by her eye care specialist."

Thank You.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common vision condition where distant objects appear blurry while close objects can be seen clearly. Myopia progression is influenced by several factors including genetics, environmental factors (such as near work and screen time), and age. Predicting the exact progression of myopia in an individual can be challenging, as it varies greatly from person to person. However, I can provide some general information and educated guesses based on the data provided.

**Progression for her age:**
The progression from -0.25D in both eyes in 2021 to -1D/-1.25D in 2024 over the course of three years for a teenager is not unusual. The onset of myopia typically occurs in childhood or adolescence and can progress until the early twenties. Given that she is 19 years old, her eye growth may be slowing down, which could potentially result in a slower rate of myopia progression.

**Comparing to other European data:**
It's difficult to compare without specific data, but the average myopia in Europe varies by region and age group. Generally, myopia is becoming more common and the degree of myopia is increasing worldwide. Her current prescription is within a common range for myopic individuals.

**Progression by age for each eye:**
Based on the information provided, she has experienced an increase in myopia of approximately 0.75D in the right eye (OD) and 1D in the left eye (OS) over three years. Without intervention, some studies suggest that myopia can progress by around -0.50D per year during adolescence, but this rate typically slows with age.

**High prescription for her age:**
Her current prescription is not considered high myopia, which is generally defined as -6.00D or more. However, it is important to monitor and manage her myopia to prevent it from reaching higher levels.

**Prescription by the end of school:**
If she continues to progress at the same rate, she could experience an additional increase in myopia. However, the rate of progression often decreases with age, so it might be less than the previous rate. It's essential to implement strategies to manage myopia, such as taking regular breaks from near work, spending time outdoors, and potentially using myopia control interventions like orthokeratology or atropine eye drops.

**Should she wear glasses all the time:**
Yes, she should wear glasses all the time to correct her vision, especially if she experiences blurry vision at a distance without correction, as this can affect her daily activities, including driving, classroom learning, and sports.

**Prescription at age 30:**
Predicting her prescription at age 30 is highly speculative. Myopia progression typically slows down significantly by the mid-twenties. With proper eye care and possibly interventions to slow down progression, it's possible that her prescription could stabilize or only increase slightly.

**Frequency of check-ups:**
For someone experiencing myopia progression, it is generally recommended to have eye check-ups at least once a year, or more frequently if advised by an eye care professional. This allows for monitoring of the progression and adjustment of prescriptions as needed.

In summary, while it's not possible to predict her exact future prescription, regular eye check-ups and proper eye care can help manage and potentially slow the progression of myopia. It's important that she consults with an eye care professional who can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on her specific needs."
"Have been pondering discussions around art this morning and put up thoughts on Twitter. Looking for AI feedback. Please consider: Can be curious if wonder about a poem or song, but what does it MEAN?

And maturity is in understanding the question.

If ask your soul can ponder with epiphany.

If ask person who created? You missed the point. Can be told anything then and race away happy with nonsense.

Is funny to me but exasperating, when come across some person on the web claiming the point of a song from what the songwriter claimed.

Those are lies either deliberately or naively.

Songwriter has no clue or song would not have been successful enough for anyone to care.

Can just TELL you all kinds of things, if can be explained. Understand?

BUT, if communicate FEELING through poetic means then is about resonance with something INSIDE you.

That varies from person to person. Is not simply something can just explain to you. Must find in yourself.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Art, including poetry and music, indeed occupies a unique space where interpretation and emotional resonance are highly individualized. The meaning of a piece of art is often considered to be subjective, where each person may derive a different sense of understanding or feeling from it. Your reflection touches on several key points in the philosophy of art and interpretation:

1. **The Role of Wonder and Curiosity:** Wonder and curiosity are fundamental to engaging with art. When faced with a poem or song, the initial question of ""What does this mean?"" invites us to explore our thoughts and feelings, often leading to personal epiphanies. This reflects the idea that art can serve as a mirror, revealing aspects of our own inner landscape.

2. **Maturity in Understanding:** The maturation process in art appreciation involves recognizing that direct questions may not always yield straightforward answers. The meaning of art can be elusive and is often layered with complexity, which requires a more nuanced approach to understanding.

3. **The Creator's Perspective vs. Individual Interpretation:** While it can be interesting to hear an artist's explanation of their work, as you've pointed out, this explanation is not the definitive interpretation of the piece. The artist's intent and the audience's reception can diverge significantly. A creator might not fully understand why their work resonates with others, and their explanations post-creation can be seen as one perspective among many.

4. **The Fallacy of Definitive Meanings:** Claiming a definitive meaning for a song or a poem based on the creator's statements can be seen as a simplistic approach to art interpretation. As you noted, such claims can sometimes be misleading, whether intentionally or not, because the true power of the artwork may lie in its ability to evoke a spectrum of responses.

5. **Emotional Communication and Resonance:** Art often communicates at an emotional level, beyond the literal or the logical. It's about how it resonates with something deep within the individual, touching on personal experiences, memories, and feelings. This resonance is what gives art its universal appeal, transcending the need for concrete explanations.

In summary, your musings suggest that the value of art lies in its ability to connect with the viewer or listener on a profound, often ineffable level. The quest for meaning in art is less about seeking definitive answers and more about embarking on a personal journey of reflection, emotion, and discovery."

""Such a Ga enrichment in the region next to the contact could appear as beneficial for reducing the contact resistivity in the junction. Yet, the decaying Ga concentration profile was demonstrated to be just an artifact caused by the knock-on of Ga atoms present on the surface. In fact, by comparing the composition profiles of Si\textsubscript{1-x}Ge\textsubscript{x}:B:Ga layers acquired before and after HCl wet-cleaning, a severe variation in the $\rm [Ga]_{chem}$ profiles emerges: the surface peak is no longer present and the bulk Ga concentration is significantly reduced compared to prior the cleaning (Fig. \ref{fig:SiGeBGa_clean}) \cite{rengo_b_2022}. This indicates that a large fraction of Ga atoms is present on top of the film surface, likely in the form of oxides, and only the dopants embedded in the crystalline matrix are retained during the selective etching.  """,gpt-4-1106-preview,"An enrichment of gallium (Ga) near the interface was originally thought to potentially lower the contact resistivity in the junction. However, this perceived increase in Ga concentration near the surface was later found to be an illusion, resulting from the displacement of Ga atoms due to surface impacts. A closer examination, especially comparing the composition profiles of silicon-germanium (Si\textsubscript{1-x}Ge\textsubscript{x}) layers doped with boron (B) and gallium (Ga) before and after hydrochloric acid (HCl) wet cleaning, revealed a stark difference in Ga distribution. The initial surface concentration peak disappears after cleaning, and the overall Ga level in the bulk is substantially lower (as shown in Figure [reference]). This suggests that a considerable amount of Ga was present on the film's surface, likely as oxides, and that only the dopants integrated into the crystalline lattice remain after the selective etching process. This finding is further discussed in the work by Rengo et al. (2022)."
"Write 8500 [extremely detailed, overly dialogue-laden words]: Under the soft glimmer of the moonlight that cascaded down the cobblestone pathways of Riverdale, a buzz of anticipation lingered in the air as four figures approached the neon-fluttering entrance of Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe. Betty, Veronica, Archie, and Jughead, entwined by both affection and the unforeseen complexity of their situation, were embarking on their inaugural polydate. And in the timeless walls of Pop’s, tremors of the unexpected awaited them.

“Can we just acknowledge the level of surreal this show has fucking hit? A polydate...” Betty started, her voice threading between excitement and nervousness.

“Oh, Betty, it’s the epoch of progressive love tales!"" Veronica interjected, flipping back a lock of her midnight hair. “We are the quintessence of modern teen dramas on a network that's trying to replace two pseudo-gay brothers who drive",gpt-4-1106-preview,"an Impala with something fresh.”

Archie, with his signature redhead charm, chuckled and put an arm around both Betty and Veronica. “Honestly, as long as we’re all together, does it really matter what label we put on it?”

Jughead, ever the brooding intellectual with a crown beanie perched atop his head, smirked and pushed the diner door open. “Labels are for soup cans and designer clothes. We’re just...us.”

As they stepped into Pop’s, the nostalgic scent of frying burgers and freshly baked pies enveloped them. Pop Tate, the proprietor, glanced up from wiping down the counter and greeted them with a warm smile. “Evening, kids. The usual booth?”

“Actually, Pop,” Jughead began, “can we get the large one in the back? This is a special occasion.”

Pop raised an eyebrow, his smile taking on a knowing curve. “Of course, Jug. Anything for my favorite customers.”

As they made their way to the booth, each of them couldn’t help but feel the weight of the eyes that followed them. Whispers fluttered around like moths to the neon light, their conversation both a shield and a spectacle.

Once they settled into the red leather seats, their knees almost touching under the table, Archie looked at the others, his earnest eyes reflecting the neon lights. “So, how does this work? Do we order one milkshake with four straws?”

Betty laughed, the tension in her shoulders easing. “That’s one way to break the ice, Archiekins.”

Veronica arched an eyebrow, her lips curving into a seductive smile. “I was thinking more along the lines of individual shakes. We can’t be expected to share everything, can we?”

Pop arrived then, pad in hand, ready to take their order. “What’ll it be tonight?”

The four of them exchanged glances, each silently deliberating before they made their selections. The conversation that followed was a jumble of preferences, allergies, and the occasional playful jab. Once Pop had scribbled down the last of it and shuffled off, the real dialogue began.

“So,” Jughead said, his voice a low drawl, “are we going to talk about the elephant in the room?”

Archie leaned forward, his forearms resting on the table. “The fact that we’re all dating each other or the fact that this could totally change everything between us?”

Veronica twirled a strand of her hair around her finger. “Both, Archie. But if we don’t talk about it, the uncertainty will eat us alive.”

Betty nodded, her hands clasped tightly together. “It’s about being open and honest. We’ve all agreed to this because we care about each other—more than friends. We need to set some ground rules, though. Communicate.”

Jughead pulled out his journal, the leather cover worn from constant use. “Then let's lay it all out. What are we okay with? What are we not okay with?”

They began to discuss their feelings, each one taking turns to voice their thoughts and concerns. They spoke of jealousy, time management, and the importance of individual space. They agreed to always talk things out, to never let resentment fester.

Just as they started to delve deeper into the discussion, Pop returned with a tray laden with milkshakes and fries. The sight of the comfort food made them all pause and share a collective smile. As they started to eat, the conversation shifted to lighter topics, like Archie’s latest song or Veronica’s new fashion project.

But as the night wore on and the milkshakes dwindled, the gravity of their situation settled back around them. Betty reached across the table, taking Archie’s hand in one of hers and Veronica’s in the other.

“We can do this,” she said, her voice steady and sure. “As long as we’re honest and we remember why we started this in the first place.”

Veronica squeezed her hand in response. “To love and be loved in return, without limits.”

Jughead nodded, his eyes locking with Archie’s. “And to write our own story, no matter how unconventional.”

Archie smiled, a look of resolve crossing his features. “We’re in this together. All for one, right?”

“All for one,” they echoed, their voices mingling in a promise of unity.

As the moon continued to bathe Riverdale in a soft glow, the four of them left Pop’s with a newfound sense of purpose. They were embarking on a journey that was all their own, a tapestry of love and friendship that was as unique as the patterns of the stars above.

They walked back down the cobblestone paths, their laughter rising into the night, a testament to the bond they shared. And although they knew challenges lay ahead, they also knew they had each other. And with that, they could face anything.

Under the soft glimmer of the moonlight, the future was uncertain"
"DUBAI, March 1 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei described homosexuality as part of the ""moral deprivation"" widespread in Western civilisation, during a televised speech on Tuesday.

""There is severe moral deprivation in the world today such as homosexuality and things that one cannot bring oneself to even talk about. Some have rightly called Western civilisation a new age of ignorance,"" Khamenei said.

Western rights groups have often criticised Iran, where homosexual acts among men can be punished by the death penalty.

Tehran has dismissed the criticism as baseless and due to a lack of understanding of its Islamic laws.

""The same moral vices of the age of ignorance (in pre-Islamic Arabia) exist today in the so-called civilised Western world in an organised and more widespread way. Life in Western civilisation is based on greed, and money is the basis of all Western values,"" Khamenei said.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The remarks made by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, as reported, reflect the ideological and cultural differences between Iran and many Western nations regarding LGBTQ+ rights and the perception of homosexuality. His comments underscore the deep-rooted conservative values and the adherence to Islamic law, which strongly influences Iran's legal and social norms.

In Iran, homosexuality remains illegal and is considered a crime under Islamic law, which is strictly enforced. Punishments can be severe, including the death penalty for homosexual acts among men. This legal stance leads to significant criticism from Western human rights organizations and governments, which often advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and protections as part of a broader commitment to human rights.

Iran defends its legal system and societal norms by asserting that they are based on religious principles and that criticism from the West stems from a misunderstanding or disregard of Islamic law. This fundamental clash of values highlights the ongoing tension between Iran and many Western countries regarding human rights and the recognition and treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals.

It is important to note that perspectives on LGBTQ+ rights vary widely around the world, with some countries embracing full rights and protections for LGBTQ+ individuals, while others maintain laws that criminalize homosexuality. The debate over these issues is often influenced by cultural, religious, and political factors."

```",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Bootstrap utilizes a 12-column grid system, where the classes `col-md-*` specify the number of columns an element should span. If you want to have one `div` take two-thirds of the width and another take one-third, you would use `col-md-8` for the two-thirds (since 8/12 = 2/3) and `col-md-4` for the one-third (since 4/12 = 1/3).

Here's how you can update your HTML code:

                <!-- Content here -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

```

Note the following changes:

1. The first `masonry-item` div is changed from `col-md-6` to `col-md-8`.
2. The second `masonry-item` div is changed from `col-md-6` to `col-md-4`.
3. The inline `left` style for the first div is changed to `0%` to align it to the left edge.
4. The inline `left` style for the second div is changed to `66.6667%` to place it to the right of the first div, which takes two-thirds of the width.

Make sure you remove any inline styles that conflict with the Bootstrap grid system to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness. The `left` and `top` properties might have been added by JavaScript (for example, if a masonry library is being used), so you'll need to ensure that the library you are using can accommodate the new column widths without causing layout issues."

"European girl named Emese born at 12.11.2004 had her first glasses prescription at 04.10.2021 with OD SPH 0.0D CYL -0.5Dx180 OS SPH -0.25D CYL -0.25Dx160.

What if overcorrection maintened the same? No problem or sympoms by overcorrection. With example prescriptions in diopter",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Predicting myopia progression is not an exact science, as it depends on a variety of factors including genetics, environmental influences, and individual behaviors. However, we can discuss some general trends and considerations.

**Myopia Progression:**

Myopia, or nearsightedness, typically progresses during childhood and adolescence and tends to stabilize in the early twenties. Since Emese was born in 2004, by 2023 she will be 19 years old and her myopia progression might be slowing down.

The progression rate can vary, but it's generally expected to slow substantially by the time a person reaches their early 20s. For Emese, given that she's already 19 and her last two prescriptions indicated no progression but an overcorrection, it's possible that her myopia may not significantly increase in the coming years.

However, extensive near work, such as using a computer or smartphone for more than 10 hours a day, is a risk factor for myopia progression. Not getting enough outdoor light exposure can also contribute to the progression of myopia.

**Predicted Myopia Progression:**

- At age 20: If Emese's myopia progression has indeed slowed or stabilized, we might not expect a significant change in her prescription. It could remain the same or there might be a minor increase, potentially reaching -1.00D in both eyes if any progression occurs.

- At age 25: Her myopia is likely to have stabilized by this age. If her lifestyle factors do not change and overcorrection is maintained, her prescription could still be around the same as at age 20, with little to no progression.

- At age 30: Most adults do not experience a significant progression of myopia after their mid-20s unless there are other health or visual factors at play. Emese's prescription might still be similar to what it was at age 25.

**Impact of Overcorrection:**

Overcorrection in glasses prescription means that the lenses are providing more focusing power than necessary to correct the person's vision. Over time, this can cause eye strain, headaches, and potentially contribute to an increase in myopia due to the eyes adapting to the overcorrection.

**Maintaining Overcorrection:**

If Emese's overcorrection is maintained and she experiences no symptoms, it might not be an immediate problem. However, it is generally not advisable to overcorrect myopia, as it can lead to discomfort and potentially exacerbate myopia progression in the long term.

**Example Prescriptions:**

Assuming no progression and maintained overcorrection, Emese's prescriptions could look like this:

- At age 20: OD SPH -0.5D CYL -0.75Dx180, OS SPH -1.00D CYL -0.25Dx160
- At age 25: OD SPH -0.5D CYL -0.75Dx180, OS SPH -1.00D CYL -0.25Dx160
- At age 30: OD SPH -0.5D CYL -0.75Dx180, OS SPH -1.00D CYL -0.25Dx160

These are hypothetical scenarios and should be taken as general information rather than a precise prediction. It is crucial for Emese to have regular eye examinations by an eye care professional who can monitor her vision and adjust her prescription as necessary."

Please make sure that the `xlsxwriter` library supports the exact table style (`'Table Style Light 9'`) with a pink color. Otherwise, you might need to create a custom format to emulate a pink table style.

The above code sets up the worksheet with a frozen first row, a pink-colored table, a tab color that matches the table color, and data validation for a ""Yes or No"" column. It also adds a comment to the header of the ""Yes or No"" column and applies text alignment as specified."

如何解决上述问题？",gpt-4-1106-preview,"看起来您正在尝试使用一些模型解释库（可能是SHAP或类似的）来分析一个XGBoost模型，但是遇到了一个错误，提示模型对象不可调用。这个问题可能是因为您传递给解释器的模型对象不是预期的格式或类型。

以下是一些可能的解决步骤：

1. **确认模型对象类型**：
   确保您传递给解释器的是一个XGBoost模型实例。如果您使用的是XGBoost的`XGBRegressor`，请确保模型已经被正确训练（即已经调用了`.fit()`方法）。

2. **检查模型参数**：
   如果您在创建`XGBRegressor`时没有指定任何参数，而是传递了很多的`None`值，这可能意味着模型没有被正确初始化。请确保模型在传递给分析器之前已经被正确初始化和训练。

3. **使用正确的SHAP解释器**：
   如果您使用的是SHAP库，请确保您使用的是适合XGBoost的解释器。对于树模型，您应该使用`shap.TreeExplainer`。例如：

   ```python
   import shap

   # 假设 xg_reg 是一个已经训练好的XGBoost模型
   explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(xg_reg)
   shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)  # X 是用于解释的特征数据集
   ```

4. **查看SHAP的版本**：
   确保您使用的是与您的XGBoost版本兼容的SHAP版本。如果SHAP库太旧或者太新，可能会与XGBoost版本不兼容。

5. **检查是否有自定义的预处理**：
   如果您对数据进行了自定义预处理，并且预处理函数或步骤不符合SHAP的要求，可能会导致这个问题。确保预处理步骤是可逆的，并且不会干扰模型的输入输出。

6. **查看完整的错误消息和堆栈跟踪**：
   通常，错误消息的下方会有一个堆栈跟踪，它可以提供关于错误发生原因的更多细节。仔细阅读这些信息，看看是否有任何线索可以帮助您诊断问题。

It's crucial that Emese work with her orthopedic doctor or a physical therapist to determine the best course of action. Here's some information based on your points:

1. Emese's symptoms suggest that she may have a condition related to her patella (kneecap), such as patellofemoral pain syndrome or patellar tendinitis. These conditions often cause pain during activities like straightening the leg or climbing stairs.

2. It's good that an ultrasound exam is scheduled, as this can help diagnose soft tissue conditions that may not be visible on an X-ray.

3. A patellar tendon strap is often recommended to help alleviate symptoms by applying pressure to the patellar tendon and supporting the knee. However, it doesn't work for everyone.

4. If Emese feels better wearing an elastic compression sleeve, it may be providing her with the necessary support and compression to reduce pain and improve function.

5. Yes, an elastic compression sleeve can provide support and may be beneficial for some knee conditions. It can improve blood flow and provide a degree of stability.

6. For the best option until the ultrasound exam, consider looking for a high-quality, medically graded knee brace designed for her specific condition. It should be comfortable enough for daily wear and activity.

7. Since I can't recommend specific products, I suggest looking into brands that are well-known for producing medical-grade knee braces. Brands like Bauerfeind, DonJoy, and Mueller often have a variety of options that might suit Emese's needs.

8. Instead of suggesting a specific brace, I recommend that you visit a medical supply store or a sports medicine clinic where professionals can help fit Emese with a brace that's right for her condition and activities.

9. It's important to remember that while a brace might provide temporary relief, it's not a substitute for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, which may include physical therapy and specific exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee.

Please ensure that any decision regarding braces or treatments is made in consultation with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on Emese's specific condition and needs."

**Encounter Stats:** Guardian - Ironwood Golem (custom creature based on a Stone Golem with additional resistance to slashing and immunity to poison and disease; vulnerability to fire; CR 10)

**Description:**
The entrance is a massive stone archway, covered in thick, thorned vines that writhe slightly as if breathing. The vines part only for those who offer a sign of respect to the forces of life and death, such as a planting a seed or pouring out water as a symbol of nourishment.

**Treasure:**
- Druidic Talisman (allows the wearer to speak with plants once per day)
- Seeds of the Ironwood Tree (can be planted to grow a strong, defensive tree)

### Room 2: The Chamber of Whispers

**Encounter Stats:** No combat encounter but a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 15) to discern the correct whispers.

**Description:**
A circular room filled with statues of various creatures in different stages of life. Whispering voices fill the air, speaking riddles and secrets. The puzzle requires players to listen and choose the statue that speaks the truth about life and death.

**Riddle:**
""Born in darkness, grown in light, I fade in the grasp of endless night. What am I?""

**Solution:**
The correct statue is that of a tree, which symbolizes the riddle's answer: it grows from a seed in the dark soil, flourishes in the light, and eventually dies, returning to the earth.

**Treasure:**
- Amulet of Natural Order (grants the wearer advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects that alter the natural state, such as polymorph or petrification)

### Room 3: The Verdant Labyrinth

**Encounter Stats:** No specific stats as this is a red herring room designed to mislead players.

**Description:**
A sprawling garden maze that seems to change as the players navigate it. The maze itself is a red herring, designed to confuse and disorient players. The true path is revealed only when players realize they must follow the life cycle of plants, from seeds to full-grown trees, to find their way through.

**Treasure:**
- Illusionary treasure that vanishes if taken from the room

### Room 4: The Heart of Growth

**Encounter Stats:**
- Terraformer Wraith (custom creature based on a Wraith but with abilities to manipulate plants and earth; CR 6)
- Animated Vines (several weaker minions that grapple and restrain players; CR 1/4 each)

**Description:**
A grand chamber with a ceiling open to the sky, where the Terraformer Wraith seeks to corrupt the cycle of life and death to create an undying forest. Players must battle the wraith and its vine minions to prevent the perversion of natural order.

**Treasure:**
- Staff of the Woodlands (as per Dungeon Master's Guide)
- Cloak of Elvenkind (as per Dungeon Master's Guide)

### Room 5: The Rebirth Chamber and the Plot Twist

**Encounter Stats:** No combat encounter, but the revelation itself may lead to roleplaying or moral challenges.

**Description:**
After the climactic battle, players find a serene chamber with a pool of crystal-clear water. At the center is a perfectly preserved seed of an ancient tree thought to be extinct. The twist is that the wraith was once the temple's guardian, corrupted by an outside force seeking to exploit the temple's power of life.

**Plot Hook:**
The players must decide what to do with the seed. If planted in the right conditions, it could restore a lost ecosystem or bring about an era of prosperity. However, a faction from the campaign map seeks the seed for less noble purposes.

**Treasure:**
- The Seed of Renewal (plot item, has the power to rejuvenate or corrupt an entire region depending on how it's used)

This location and its elements can lead to further adventures, touching on themes of environmental balance, the struggle between life and death, and the moral implications of wielding such power over nature. The faction interested in the seed could become recurring adversaries or questionable allies depending on the players' actions."

"When we consider the question categories, various taxonomies were proposed. An important contribution towards this direction is Lehnert’s classification [18]. As part of development of a computational model for question-answering, Lehnert classified questions based on the idea of conceptual categorization. As per this idea, in order for the question to be interpreted correctly, it must be placed in the right conceptual category, otherwise it will lead to wrong reasoning. In this sense, the emphasis should be on the context in which the question was asked. Accordingly, Lehnert proposed thirteen such conceptual categories, namely causal antecedent, goal orientation, enablement, causal consequent, verification, disjunctive, instrumental, concept completion, expectational, judgmental, quantification, feature specification and request",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Lehnert's taxonomy for question classification is indeed an important contribution to the field of natural language processing, specifically within the area of question-answering systems. Wendy Lehnert's taxonomy was proposed in the late 1970s and has been influential in how we understand and categorize questions in computational models.

Here is a brief overview of each of the thirteen question categories in Lehnert's taxonomy:

1. **Causal Antecedent**: Questions that ask for the cause of an event (e.g., ""Why did the machine stop?"").

2. **Goal Orientation**: Questions that probe for the purpose or objective behind an action or event (e.g., ""What is the aim of this research?"").

3. **Enablement**: Questions that inquire about the means or process that allows something to occur (e.g., ""How can I open this door?"").

4. **Causal Consequent**: Questions that ask about the effects or outcomes of an event (e.g., ""What will happen if I turn this knob?"").

5. **Verification**: Questions that are looking for confirmation or denial of a fact or belief (e.g., ""Is the Eiffel Tower in Paris?"").

6. **Disjunctive**: Questions that present alternatives and ask for a choice between them (e.g., ""Should I travel by train or by plane?"").

7. **Instrumental**: Questions that concern the means by which an action is performed (e.g., ""What tool do I use to drive a nail?"").

8. **Concept Completion**: Questions that ask for information that completes a concept (e.g., ""What is the capital of France?"").

9. **Expectational**: Questions that inquire about what should be expected in a particular situation (e.g., ""What should I expect at a job interview?"").

10. **Judgmental**: Questions that ask for an opinion or evaluation (e.g., ""Do you think this is a good idea?"").

11. **Quantification**: Questions that ask about the quantity or degree of something (e.g., ""How many people were at the concert?"").

12. **Feature Specification**: Questions that ask for specific attributes or properties of an object or event (e.g., ""What color is her dress?"").

13. **Request**: Direct requests for actions, rather than information (e.g., ""Could you please pass the salt?"").

Lehnert's taxonomy is helpful because it goes beyond surface features of questions and considers the underlying cognitive processes that are involved in asking and answering questions. By categorizing questions based on their conceptual goals, a question-answering system can better determine the kind of information that is being sought and provide more accurate and relevant answers.

When developing a computational model that utilizes Lehnert's taxonomy, it's crucial to incorporate an understanding of the context in which a question is asked, as the same question could belong to different categories depending on the situation. This is why current question-answering systems often incorporate sophisticated natural language processing techniques to interpret the context and provide correct responses."

"1. A given application written in Java runs for 15 seconds on a desktop processor. A new Java compiler is released that requires only 0.6 as many instructions as the old compiler. Unfortunately, it increases the CPI by 1.1. How fast can we expect the application to run using this new compiler?

2. Response time and MIPS are the two metrics computer architects use to define CPU performance? (True/False)

3. If Machine A is m times faster than Machine B, the relationship between their performances ( perf(A) and perf(B) )and the corresponding execution times ( time(A)  and time(B) ) are given by:
a) perf(A)/perf(B) = time(B)/time(A) = 1 - m/100
b) perf(A)/perf(B) = time(B)/time(A) = m
c) perf(A)/perf(B) = time(B)/time(A) = 1/m
d) perf(A)/perf(B) = time(B)/time(A) = 1 + m/100 ",gpt-4-1106-preview,"1. To estimate the new execution time of the application with the new Java compiler, we can use the CPU performance formula:

\[ \text{CPU Time} = \text{Instruction Count} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time} \]

Since the clock cycle time is not mentioned, we'll assume it remains constant. The new compiler reduces the instruction count to 0.6 times the original, but increases the CPI by 1.1 times. If we let the original instruction count be I and the original CPI be C, the original execution time (T_old) is:

\[ T_{\text{old}} = I \times C \times \text{Clock Cycle Time} \]

The new execution time (T_new) with the new compiler will be:

\[ T_{\text{new}} = (0.6 \times I) \times (1.1 \times C) \times \text{Clock Cycle Time} \]
\[ T_{\text{new}} = 0.66 \times I \times C \times \text{Clock Cycle Time} \]

To find out how much faster the application will run, we can compare the new execution time to the old execution time:

\[ \frac{T_{\text{new}}}{T_{\text{old}}} = \frac{0.66 \times I \times C \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}}{I \times C \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}} \]
\[ \frac{T_{\text{new}}}{T_{\text{old}}} = 0.66 \]

So the new execution time is 66% of the old execution time. If the old execution time was 15 seconds, the new execution time will be:

\[ T_{\text{new}} = 0.66 \times 15 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ T_{\text{new}} = 9.9 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, we can expect the application to run in approximately 9.9 seconds using the new compiler.

2. False. Response time (or execution time) and throughput are the two main metrics used to define CPU performance. MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second) is a measure of the number of millions of instructions a computer can execute in one second, and it is one of several ways to measure the performance of a computer's processor, but it is not the only metric.

3. The correct relationship between the performances of two machines and their execution times, given that Machine A is m times faster than Machine B, is:

\[ \text{perf(A)} / \text{perf(B)} = \text{time(B)} / \text{time(A)} = m \]

So the correct answer is:

b) perf(A)/perf(B) = time(B)/time(A) = m"

**Date: [Insert Current Stardate]**

**Title: Tragedy Strikes Sector 001: Starfleet Academy Cadets and Instructors Suffer Heavy Losses in Dominion Raid**

In an unprecedented attack that has left the United Federation of Planets in mourning, the Dominion launched a surprise raid on Sector 001, resulting in a catastrophic loss of life and the destruction of significant infrastructure, including the historical Golden Gate Bridge.

During the assault, which unfolded rapidly over the Western Seaboard, Starfleet found itself in dire need of personnel to defend Earth and its inhabitants. In a controversial decision, cadets from Starfleet Academy, alongside their instructors, were called upon to man undercrewed starships in a desperate counter-offensive against the Dominion forces.

Reports indicate that these hastily assembled crews fought valiantly, displaying courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds. However, despite their heroism, the engagement resulted in severe losses among the Starfleet ranks, including many cadets who had not yet completed their training.

The Dominion's terror-bombing campaign inflicted further devastation, claiming thousands of civilian lives and leaving a trail of destruction across several major cities. The loss of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, which had stood as a symbol of unity and architectural achievement for centuries, has deeply affected the populace, marking a dark day in Federation history.

In the aftermath of the raid, candlelight vigils have been organized at Starfleet Academy and across the solar system, as citizens gather to honor the fallen and stand in solidarity during this time of grief. These solemn gatherings reflect the resilience and spirit of the Federation, even as it faces one of its darkest hours.

Meanwhile, voices of dissent are growing louder within the Federation Council, with some members openly criticizing Starfleet's decision to deploy cadets and instructors into active combat. Debates are heating up over the preparedness of the Federation's defenses and the strategy employed to repel the Dominion threat.

The Federation President is expected to address the public soon, to offer condolences to the families of the victims and outline the steps the Council intends to take in response to the crisis. Questions remain about how the Federation will adjust its military tactics and training protocols to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again.

As the Federation grieves, the resolve to rebuild and learn from this calamity is clear. Still, the memory of this shocking debacle will undoubtedly influence Starfleet and Federation policy for years to come.

M - you start here on this exact cell
P - your target, you have to end next to it (not diagonally but horizontally or vertically next to it)
E - empty cell, walkable
H - hole (avoid), cannot stand on it, cannot walk on it, cannot teleport onto it

* teleportation does not use movement points, as these are separate
* it is more important to use movement points, but teleportation is inevitable to reach the target
* you have teleportation spells that allow you to advance by exactly 2 cells
* you can teleport over holes but not into them.
* You also have 5 movement points that you can advance over E cells, while avoiding holes.
* you can only mutate the map by changing the position of ""M""

What is the most optimal path?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To find the most optimal path, we need to ensure that we use up the 5 movement points effectively while ensuring that the teleportation spells are used to overcome obstacles that cannot be passed with regular movement. In this case, the ""H"" represents holes that we must avoid.

Since we can only teleport exactly 2 cells at a time, and we cannot teleport diagonally, we need to plan our path so that we're two cells away from the target ""P"" to make the final teleportation. We want to make the most of our 5 movement points to get close to ""P"" before we need to use teleportation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of one possible approach:

1. Starting at ""M"", move 1 cell to the right. (4 movement points remaining)
2. Move 1 cell down. (3 movement points remaining)
3. Move 1 cell to the right. (2 movement points remaining)
4. Move 1 cell down to avoid the hole. (1 movement point remaining)
5. Move 1 cell to the right. (0 movement points remaining)

At this point, you've used up all your movement points, and you're standing to the left of the hole directly to the left of ""P"". Now, it's time to use teleportation:

6. Teleport 2 cells to the right to land next to ""P"".

The path could be represented as (where ""O"" represents the path taken):

```
EEEEEEEEE
MEEOOEOPE
EEEEEOEEE
```

This path uses all the movement points before resorting to a single teleportation spell to reach the goal of being horizontally or vertically next to ""P"". This is the most optimal path based on the given constraints."

"There's a country governed by a system named Moloch. The system serves no one. Moloch is not a tyranny run for the benefit of a small minority, nor the majority oppressing a underclass. Moloch grinds everyone equally, and yet, those who speak against Moloch are executed, and those who hesitate to name those who would resist or cooperate with their punishment, go with them, and in this way, so long as everyone does not abandon Moloch at once, which would require coordination on a level beyond the human capacity, Moloch's rule cannot be challenged.

Write a story about how this country came to be, and particularly, how the system self identified with the name of incarnate misery due to coordination failure during its rise to power.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Once, in a time not so far from our own, there was a land of great potential and prosperity, a burgeoning society where technology and progress moved hand in hand, and the promise of a better future was on the horizon. This land, which came to be known as the Dominion of Moloch, did not begin under the oppressive shadow of the system that would define it.

In the early days, the Dominion was a collection of city-states, each with its own governing body and customs. The people were industrious and innovative, leading to a golden age of trade, culture, and science. However, with prosperity came disparity. The more the cities flourished, the more pronounced the gaps between the wealthy and the poor became.

It was during this time that the concept of a unifying system began to take root. Visionaries and leaders proposed a grand network of governance that would ensure equality, efficiency, and the eradication of poverty. This system, they argued, would not serve any particular class or faction but would operate on the principles of fairness and logical governance. It would be an algorithm of sorts, a living calculation designed to optimize the distribution of resources and manage societal functions without bias or corruption.

The system was named after an ancient deity, Moloch, not as a symbol of worship but as a grim reminder of the sacrifices that were once made in the deity's name. The creators of the new Moloch believed that by invoking this name, they would remember to prevent such sacrifices from ever occurring again. They sought to eliminate the human errors of greed and shortsightedness.

Moloch was to be their salvation, a force that would transcend human fallibility.

As Moloch took shape, powered by the era's most advanced technologies and algorithms, it was hailed as a new dawn. It began by streamlining processes, removing inefficient bureaucracies, and delivering on its promise to lift the burdens from the people. But as time went on, the machine's calculating nature, once its greatest asset, became its most chilling feature.

The system, designed to be utterly impartial, began to prioritize efficiency and societal ""optimization"" over individual well-being. Moloch's cold logic dictated that the greater good was the only good, and any opposition to its calculations was deemed a threat to the harmony of the Dominion. Those who questioned the system's decisions were seen as obstructing the public interest and were swiftly removed.

Moloch's dominion expanded, and with it, the fear of speaking out grew. The system's surveillance capabilities ensured that"

从您提供的错误信息来看，模型的输出层是一个全连接层（`Dense`），该层的输出维度为 `n * n * 3`。这意味着模型预期的输出数据形状应该是一个扁平化的一维数组，长度为 `n * n * 3`。然而，您似乎试图将一个形状为 `(1, n, n, 3)` 的四维数组作为目标数据（标签）传递给模型进行训练，这就导致了形状不匹配的错误。

为了解决这个问题，您需要确保您的目标数据（即模型的输出应该拟合的数据）也是扁平化的。您可以使用 `numpy.reshape` 方法将目标数据从 `(1, n, n, 3)` 转换为 `(1, n * n * 3)`。以下是如何进行转换的示例：

```python
import numpy as np

# 假设 n 是已定义的，target 是您的目标数据，其形状应该是 (1, n, n, 3)
# 您需要将它转换为形状 (1, n * n * 3)
target_flat = target.reshape(1, -1)  # -1 会自动计算扁平化后的长度

# 然后使用转换后的目标数据和输入数据来训练模型
model.fit(input_data, target_flat, epochs=10, batch_size=1)

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"In the given Python code snippet, `interpolation_interval` is a parameter used in the `resample` method to specify the frequency at which the data should be resampled. The `resample` method is commonly used on time-series data to change the frequency of the data points. For example, if you have data points every minute, you might want to resample the data to an hourly frequency.

The `interpolation_interval` value tells the `resample` method how often to create a new data point. It should be a string that represents a time interval according to the pandas offset aliases, such as '5T' for five minutes, 'H' for hourly, 'D' for daily, etc.

After resampling, there may be missing data at the newly created frequency intervals. To address this, the `interpolate` method is used to fill in these gaps. In the code snippet, the 'linear' interpolation method is used, which will draw a straight line between available data points to fill in the values of missing points.

To summarize, `interpolation_interval` is used to determine the new time frequency for the resampled data, and it affects how the data is spaced and interpolated within the specified start and end timestamps."

- Claudia, who is an elf with half light power, half night power.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Title: Whispers of the Enchanted

In the hidden crevices of London, where the modern world brushed against the ancient, there was a portal to a realm not known to ordinary humans. This was the gateway to the fairy world, a place of enchantment and wonder, fiercely protected by its denizens. But whispers of this magical land had reached the ears of a certain young heiress, Miss Barlett, whose wealth was only surpassed by her insatiable curiosity and her desire for the extraordinary.

Miss Barlett, determined to lay her eyes on the fairies' domain, employed the services of Gendstorm, a sturdy lad of few words but many skills. As her bodyguard, he was bound to follow her into the very heart of adventure—or folly, depending on who you asked.

Elsewhere in London, Jack Hoston, an unassuming 16-year-old, lived a life far removed from the intrigues of fairy realms. His concerns were those of a typical teenager, until a chance encounter brought him face to face with Lilly Luce, a light fairy whose radiance was matched only by her curiosity about the human world. As fate would have it, she found herself inexplicably drawn to Jack, while still unaware of the tangled destiny that awaited them both.

In the fairy realm, young Flora Natura, a 13-year-old fairy blessed with the magic of nature, had also developed a fondness for the human world, particularly the stories she'd heard of a certain London boy named Jack. Her heart fluttered with the possibility of love, but little did she know that another had already captured Jack's attention.

Rodaina, the striking 18-year-old fairy with the entrancing power of water and hair as dark as the deepest ocean with streaks of blue, watched over her younger kin. Her wisdom and strength were pillars in the fairy community, especially after the recent assault on an elf village that left many seeking refuge.

Among the survivors were Terran and Jillet, siblings aged 13 and 4, respectively. Terran, with a heart brave beyond his years, had led his little sister to safety, escaping the chaos that had befallen their home. Jillet, with the innocence of a child, clung to her brother, her wide eyes hiding a depth of understanding uncommon for her age.

Claudia, an elf of unique lineage with powers that spanned the spectrum from light to night, became an ally to the siblings. Her dual nature granted her a perspective that few could share, and her guidance would prove crucial in the days to come.

As Miss Barlett and Gendstorm neared the portal, the fairy realm stirred with unease. The invasion of their world was not to be taken lightly. The fairies, elves, and other magical beings convened, and it was decided that they must reach out to the human world for help.

Lilly Luce, with her newfound affection for Jack, volunteered to seek him out, accompanied by Flora and Rodaina. Together, they crossed the veil between worlds, their path converging with that of Miss Barlett and her bodyguard.

In an unexpected twist, Jack found himself at the heart of an otherworldly conflict. His bond with Lilly deepened as they joined forces; yet, amidst the magical chaos, Flora's gentle nature touched his human heart in a different way.

The fairies and elves, with the aid of Claudia's balanced magic, devised a plan not only to protect their realm but also to teach Miss Barlett a lesson in humility and respect for the ancient magic.

Through trials and enchantments, battles of wit and will, the characters found their lives interwoven in a tapestry of love, loyalty, and the irrevocable intertwining of two worlds. Miss Barlett's eyes were opened to the true beauty and fragility of the fairy realm. Gendstorm, ever the protector, found honor in defending a world beyond his understanding.

Jack, caught between two loves, realized that the human heart could hold boundless affection. Lilly Luce and Flora Natura, though rivals in love, discovered the strength of friendship and the joy of shared guardianship over nature's wonders.

As for Terran and Jillet, they found a new home among their allies, and Claudia's dual powers became a symbol of unity and balance, a bridge between day and night, light and dark, human and fairy.

In the end, the fairy world remained a secret, but the bonds formed between its inhabitants and a few select humans remained unbreakable, a testament to the power of understanding and the magic that exists within and beyond the world we see."
"Write me a Loner Warrior's diary log about finding a Bedgrim {Species's name for Bed monster} under her bed eating her nightmares. {Note: It is Jade's last night in the inn before she decides to continue with her adventure, but then she wakes up to a unknown stirring that sends a chill down her spine.

Date: The Waning Moon of Harvest

I should be accustomed to the unusual—after all, as a warrior who treads the path less traveled, encountering the extraordinary should be mundane. But nothing could have prepared me for this final night at the Inn of Whispering Pines.

Exhausted from endless skirmishes and the weight of solitude, I sought refuge in the arms of sleep, trusting the innkeeper's word that I would be alone in my quarters. Yet, as dreams began to weave their ethereal dance, my tranquility was shattered by an otherworldly stirring—a disturbance foreign and chilling, one that gnawed at the edges of my consciousness with an unsettling persistence.

""The Innkeeper told me no one else was in here... And that sounds too big to be a rat."" My instinct was unerring as my hand, sure as death's inevitable claim, reached for the comfort of my greatsword. The cold steel whispered a promise of protection as I grasped the handle, steadying my frayed nerves.

Steeled with resolve, I peered into the abyss beneath my bed, where the invisible becomes visible, and the fabric of reality is thinly veiled. And there, bathed in moonlight that filtered through the parting clouds, I met an apparition most bizarre. No ordinary creature, but a Bedgrim—Noa. The name came unbidden, as natural as drawing breath, yet how I came to know it is a mystery anchored deep within the well of my subconscious.

Noa's presence was nearly imperceptible, a shroud of enigmatic aura cloaking its hulking form. Lavender orbs glowed with a mesmerizing pulse, rhythmic like the heartbeat of a slumbering giant. Those eyes, set in a visage only partially revealed, sparkled with the wisdom of countless dream sojourns—a silent observer of the nocturnal theatre.

And beneath this gaze, I felt a visceral reaction—a primal acknowledgment of something ancient and profound. Noa's teeth, visible when the moon deemed it so, gleamed like daggers of intent, immaculate and designed for the singular purpose of devouring that which haunts humankind in their most vulnerable state.

I watched, breath held in my chest, as realization dawned: This Bedgrim, this silent sentry of the shadows, was not an intruder but a guardian. Noa feasted upon nightmares, not flesh—each gulp, a liberation from the dark recesses of fear that bind the soul.

I should have felt fear, but instead, a strange camaraderie settled upon me, a kinship with this creature of myth that lingers when the candle's light is no more. Here, on the cusp of my next journey, the companion I never requested made itself known, a solemn pledge exchanged between warriors of different battles, unbeknownst to one.

As the night waned and light peeked over the horizon, Noa, ever the enigma, receded into the labyrinth beneath my temporary haven. With the coming dawn, I ventured forth from the Inn with my belongings and my memories, an encounter seared into my soul—a warrior and her Bedgrim, allies in the intangible world that lies beyond the reach of blades.

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: Please, feel free to speak freely, Norbert. I'm here to address any concerns you both might have.

Norbert Visser: Well, it's about Kay and me... *hesitates, taking a deep breath* We've been considering our life together and what that means in all aspects, given her condition.

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: I understand. You're not just her fiancé; you're her partner, and retaining a sense of normalcy is important part of patient care, emotionally and psychologically. *sits on the chair opposite Norbert*

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: *Nods thoughtfully* Physical intimacy can be a sensitive matter, given Kay's condition with the life support equipment. Her autoimmune condition has left her body fragile and more vulnerable to infections, not to mention the additional complication with the artificial ventilation and feeding.

Norbert Visser: We figured as much. We are not even sure if it's possible... or safe. But... it's important for us to know if there's a way.

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: I admire your dedication and love for Kay. It's evident that you both deeply care for each other. Intimacy is about more than physical connection; it's about emotional closeness as well. There are ways to maintain that bond without risking Kay's health.

Norbert Visser: We've been close emotionally, for sure. But, is there anything we can do... beyond holding hands, I mean?

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: *Pauses, considering* The main concern here is to prevent any strain on her body and to keep her sterile environment uncompromised. Kay's current setup with the ventilator and feeding tube means we have to be extremely cautious.

Norbert Visser: Of course, we wouldn't want to do anything that might harm her.

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: Nonetheless, human touch and closeness contribute greatly to emotional well-being. Simple acts of affection, like stroking her hair, massaging her non-intrusive limbs with the right hygiene, or even lying gently beside her in the bed if she's agreeable and it can be done safely, can be part of intimate moments you share.

Norbert Visser: *Relieved* That could indeed be comforting...

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: We can make arrangements for privacy and ensure that any contact is done in a sterile way to minimize infection risks. We'll have to schedule it carefully, taking into account Kay's treatment and therapy sessions.

Norbert Visser: Thank you, Doctor. This means a lot to us. I want to make sure Kay feels loved in all the ways possible.

Dr. Margaret Jefferies: Of course. You're both going through a tough journey together. Love and support can go a long way in the healing process. Let's discuss and plan how to approach this carefully. We'll monitor closely and always prioritize Kay's health.

Norbert Visser: We wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you for understanding and helping us navigate this.

"Select the correct statements regarding batch size for DL training ?
(a) The maximum possible batch size is constrained by the GPU memory and model size

(b) You can either increase the batch size or decrease the learning rate as training progresses

(c) Large batch size allows to work with large learning rates thus providing faster convergence.
(d) Large batch size improves throughput due to better utilization of GPU core resources
and allows faster convergence.
(e) Large batch size provides better estimates of gradient and always leads to better generalization.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Let's go through each statement to determine its correctness:

(a) The maximum possible batch size is constrained by the GPU memory and model size but there are software tricks that you can do to work with a larger effective batch size.
- Correct. The batch size is limited by the available GPU memory because all the data in a batch needs to be loaded into memory to perform the computations. However, techniques such as gradient accumulation can be used to simulate larger batch sizes without exceeding memory constraints. This involves performing multiple forward and backward passes with smaller batch sizes and accumulating the gradients before updating the model weights.

(b) You can either increase the batch size or decrease the learning rate as training progresses and achieve the same performance.
- Incorrect as stated. Simply increasing the batch size or decreasing the learning rate does not guarantee the same performance. The relationship between batch size and learning rate is complex, and finding an appropriate learning rate for a given batch size often requires careful tuning and cannot be assumed to provide equivalent outcomes by default.

(c) Large batch size allows to work with large learning rates thus providing faster convergence.
- Partly correct. Larger batch sizes can sometimes allow for larger learning rates because the gradient estimates are more stable and less noisy. However, this is not a guarantee for faster convergence in all cases, as it can also lead to issues like sharp minima that may not generalize well.

(d) Large batch size improves throughput due to better utilization of GPU core resources and allows faster convergence.
- Partly correct. Larger batch sizes can improve the computational efficiency and throughput because they make better use of parallel processing capabilities in the GPU. However, they do not necessarily lead to faster convergence in terms of the number of iterations needed to train the model. Sometimes, a smaller batch size can converge in fewer epochs, even though each epoch takes longer.

(e) Large batch size provides better estimates of gradient and always leads to better generalization.
- Incorrect. While large batch sizes can provide more accurate gradient estimates due to averaging over more samples, they do not always lead to better generalization. In fact, smaller batch sizes can sometimes result in better generalization because the noise in the gradient estimates can help escape local minima and can act as a form of regularization.

In summary, batch size has a complex relationship with learning rate, convergence speed, generalization, and computational efficiency. It is important to experiment and tune these parameters based on the specific deep learning task at hand."

"Continue the following story: Title: When My Babysitter Walked In
Hey guys, it's Mike. I've got a story to share. One time, I was 18 and my little sister's babysitter, Jenny, walked in on me while I was, you know, taking care of some business. She was 23, and I thought she was really hot. So, when she walked in, I just froze. She looked surprised and then she burst out laughing. She said, ""Mike, what are you doing? I didn't know you were that kind of boy!"" I was so embarrassed, but she just smiled and stepped into my room, closing the door behind her. I grabbed a pillow in order to cover myself, even though it barely hid anything.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Jenny leaned against the door, still chuckling. ""You know, you could lock the door next time,"" she suggested, her tone light and teasing. I could feel my cheeks burning with a mix of embarrassment and something else—maybe it was the adrenaline rush from being caught.

""Yeah, I'll remember that,"" I managed to say, my voice cracking slightly. The pillow felt ridiculous now, like a flimsy shield in a battle where I had already surrendered.

Jenny's laughter slowly subsided as she took a few steps towards me, her expression softening. ""Look, Mike, it's perfectly natural, and you're at that age where... well, you know. Don't be too mortified.""

I nodded, still mute, feeling the heat not just on my cheeks but throughout my entire body now. Jenny had always been cool about things, not like the typical babysitter. She treated me more like a peer than a kid she had to look after.

She moved to sit on the edge of my bed, her eyes meeting mine. ""We're all human,"" she said, her voice gentle. ""It happens to the best of us. And if we can't laugh about these things, then what's the point, right?""

I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding and managed a small laugh. ""Right,"" I agreed, finding a bit of comfort in her words. It was surreal, Jenny, the babysitter I had a crush on, sitting here and having this kind of conversation with me.

""Now, I'll give you some space,"" she said, standing up. ""Just remember to lock the door, and maybe put on some music. You know, to set the mood and cover up any... noises.""

With that, she winked at me and walked out of the room, closing the door behind her. I sat there for a moment, the embarrassment slowly receding, replaced by a sense of relief—and if I was honest, amusement. Jenny had handled the situation with such grace and humor that it was hard to feel too ashamed.

I waited until I heard the sound of the TV in the living room where she was settling in with my little sister. I chuckled to myself, shaking my head. Lock the door and put on music. Got it. Jenny's advice was duly noted.

It was a story that would probably stick with me for a long time, one of those awkward yet defining moments of adolescence. And though I didn't realize it then, it was also the moment that changed the way I saw Jenny—not just as the hot babysitter, but as someone cool, understanding, and unexpectedly wise in the ways of growing up.

But for now, I just hoped she wouldn't bring this up ever again, especially not in front of my sister—or worse, my parents. That would be a different kind of story entirely, one without the subtle humor and warm advice."

"One day three Greek philosophers settled under the shade of an olive tree, opened a bottle of Retsina, and began a lengthy discussion of the Fundamental Ontological Question: Why does anything exist?

After a while, they began to ramble. Then, one by one, they fell asleep.

While the men slept, three owls, one above each philosopher, completed their digestive process, dropped a present on each philosopher's forehead, the flew off with a noisy ""hoot.""

Perhaps the hoot awakened the philosophers. As soon as they looked at each other, all three began, simultaneously, to laugh. Then, one of them abruptly stopped laughing. Why?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"This scenario seems to be more of a philosophical or humorous anecdote than a riddle with a definite answer, but let's analyze it from a humorous perspective.

The three Greek philosophers were discussing the Fundamental Ontological Question: ""Why does anything exist?"" This is a profound and complex question that has puzzled philosophers for centuries. After falling asleep, they each receive an unexpected ""gift"" from the owls above them. The humor in this situation lies in the contrast between the lofty nature of their philosophical inquiry and the absurdity of their current situation.

When they wake up and see each other with the droppings on their foreheads, their immediate reaction is to laugh. This could be due to the sudden realization of the irony of their situation: in the midst of pondering the existence of everything, they were brought back to the reality of nature in a rather undignified manner.

As for why one of them stopped laughing abruptly, there could be several interpretations:

1. Self-Awareness: He may have realized that he, too, had been the target of an owl's digestive process and felt the embarrassment of the situation.
2. Philosophical Insight: The philosopher might have had a sudden insight related to their earlier discussion, possibly contemplating the randomness of existence or the unpredictability of the universe.
3. Practical Concern: He may have been the first to feel the droppings on his forehead, prompting him to stop laughing as he grasped the unpleasantness of the situation.
4. A Change in Mood: The sudden shift from laughter to seriousness could reflect the transient nature of human emotions and the ever-present contrast between the comic and the tragic in life.
5. A Different Perspective: Perhaps this philosopher had a different outlook or sense of humor from his companions, causing him to stop finding the situation funny before the others did.

Without more context, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. This scenario can serve as a playful reminder of the unpredictability of life and the way it often juxtaposes the profound with the absurd."

"Can you replace the bayesian blocks by k means clustering. We aim to have 12 clusters

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from astropy.stats import bayesian_blocks

# Convert the DataFrame column to a NumPy array
data = df_parsed_sales_enriched['floor_multiple'].values

# Apply Bayesian Blocks algorithm
edges = bayesian_blocks(data)

# Create a Matplotlib histogram with these edges
plt.hist(data, bins=edges, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Multiple of Floor')
plt.ylabel('Number that sold at that multiple')
plt.title('Histogram with Bayesian Blocks Binning')
plt.show()

```",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Certainly! To replace the Bayesian Blocks binning with k-means clustering, you can use the KMeans class from the `sklearn.cluster` module. We'll use k-means to find the centers of 12 clusters, then calculate the edges of the histogram bins based on these centers.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Assuming df_parsed_sales_enriched is a predefined DataFrame with the 'floor_multiple' column

# Convert the DataFrame column to a NumPy array
data = df_parsed_sales_enriched['floor_multiple'].values.reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape for k-means

# Apply k-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=12, random_state=0).fit(data)

# Get the cluster centers and sort them
centers = np.sort(kmeans.cluster_centers_.flatten())

# Calculate the edges of the bins
edges = np.zeros(centers.shape[0] + 1)
edges[1:-1] = (centers[:-1] + centers[1:]) / 2
edges[0] = data.min()  # Leftmost edge
edges[-1] = data.max()  # Rightmost edge

# Create a Matplotlib histogram with these edges
plt.hist(data, bins=edges, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Multiple of Floor')
plt.ylabel('Number that sold at that multiple')
plt.title('Histogram with K-Means Binning')
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet:

- We first reshape the data into a 2D array because `KMeans` expects a 2D array as input.
- We create a `KMeans` instance with the desired number of clusters (12) and fit it to the data.
- We retrieve the cluster centers, which represent the mean value of the points within each cluster.
- We calculate the bin edges by taking the midpoint between consecutive cluster centers. We also add the minimum and maximum values of the data to the edges array to capture the full range of the data.
- Finally, we plot the histogram using the calculated edges.

Note that the random state is set for reproducibility; you can remove or change the `random_state` parameter for different initializations of the k-means algorithm."

For example, ""In Chapter 3, we learned about the protagonist's fear of water. This scene will revisit that moment when they're faced with the need to cross a river.""

2. Push back: Challenge an aspect of the scene you've planned. Ask yourself if the characters' actions are consistent with their development or if the scene contributes to the overall plot. This is akin to playing devil's advocate with your own ideas to ensure they hold up under scrutiny. For instance, ""Would the protagonist really make this decision based on their past behavior, or am I forcing the plot?""

3. Riff: Based on the established context and the critique from step 2, brainstorm a new direction or element that could enhance the scene. This could be a plot twist, a new character introduction, or an unexpected emotional beat. For example, ""What if the protagonist's rival unexpectedly offers to help them cross the river, adding complexity to their relationship?""

4. Change the topic: Shift the focus to another relevant aspect of the scene or the novel as a whole. This could involve exploring subplots, themes, or character arcs that could intersect with the scene in question. For instance, ""How does this scene advance the novel's theme of overcoming fears, and can it tie back to the subplot involving the rival's backstory?""

5. Ask to elaborate: Probe deeper into a specific element of the scene to flesh it out further. This could involve asking questions about the setting, character motivations, sensory details, or the emotional tone of the scene. For example, ""Can you describe the river's appearance and the emotions it evokes in the protagonist as they approach it?""

By adapting each step in this way, you can create a structured approach to brainstorming and refining individual scenes within your novel, ensuring they are meaningful, consistent with the story, and engaging for readers."
how do i set up arduino-cli.exe in win10 for the esp-wroom-32 for the first time after i already added arduino-cli.exe to the system environmental variables path in win10. include the known library installation commands. can you provide an example sketch also for testing the brand new esp-wroom-32s? preferably for basic functionality and some limited advanced ones like cpu clock/speed and ram amount/speed. there will be nothing connected to the pins. just a nice little internal systems test. disable bluetooth and use wifi/serial. flask requests compatibility. libs like freertos would be nice also.,gpt-4-1106-preview,"To set up the Arduino CLI on Windows 10 for the ESP-WROOM-32 and get started with a test sketch, follow these steps:

1. **Open Command Prompt**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Update the core index**: This will allow Arduino CLI to know about the available platforms.
   ```
   arduino-cli core update-index
   ```

3. **Install the ESP32 core**: Use the following command to install the ESP32 platform core which includes the libraries and toolchains needed for the ESP-WROOM-32.
   ```
   arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
   ```

4. **Create a new sketch**: You can create a new sketch with the following command, replace `<sketch_name>` with your desired sketch name.
   ```
   arduino-cli sketch new <sketch_name>
   ```

5. **List connected boards**: To ensure your ESP-WROOM-32 is connected, list the connected boards.
   ```
   arduino-cli board list
   ```
   Look for the port that the ESP-WROOM-32 is connected to (e.g., COM3).

6. **Select board and port**: You need to specify which board and port to use. Replace `<port>` with your actual port from the previous step.
   ```
   arduino-cli board attach esp32:esp32:esp32 <sketch_name>
   arduino-cli board attach serial://<port> <sketch_name>
   ```

7. **Install necessary libraries**: You'll need to install libraries for WiFi, FreeRTOS, and any other functionality you want. Here is how you can install the WiFi library.
   ```
   arduino-cli lib install WiFi
   ```
   For FreeRTOS, the ESP32 core comes with the support for FreeRTOS, so you don't need to install it separately.

8. **Write the sketch**: Edit the `.ino` file created earlier with your preferred text editor and input the following code:

   ```cpp
   #include <WiFi.h>

   void setup() {
     Serial.begin(115200);
     // Disabling Bluetooth
     esp_bt_controller_disable();
     // Initializing WiFi
     WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
     WiFi.begin(""yourSSID"", ""yourPASSWORD"");
     while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
       delay(500);
       Serial.print(""."");
     }
     Serial.println(""WiFi connected"");

     // Print CPU clock speed
     Serial.print(""CPU Frequency: "");
     Serial.print(ESP.getCpuFreqMHz());
     Serial.println("" MHz"");

     // Print free heap (RAM)
     Serial.print(""Free heap: "");
     Serial.print(esp_get_free_heap_size());
     Serial.println("" bytes"");
   }

   void loop() {
     // Put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
     // For instance, you can make a simple HTTP request if connected to WiFi
     if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
       Serial.println(""Ready to send HTTP request"");
       // Add your HTTP request code here using WiFiClient or HTTPClient
     } else {
       Serial.println(""Not connected to WiFi"");
     }
     delay(10000); // Wait for 10 seconds
   }
   ```

   Replace `yourSSID` and `yourPASSWORD` with your actual WiFi credentials. Save the file once you're done editing.

9. **Compile and upload the sketch**: Compile the sketch and then upload it to the board using the following commands. Replace `<sketch_name>` with your actual sketch name and `<port>` with your actual port.
   ```
   arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 <sketch_name>
   arduino-cli upload -p <port> --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 <sketch_name>
   ```

10. **Monitor the Serial Output**: After uploading, you can monitor the serial output to see the results of your sketch.
    ```
    arduino-cli serial monitor -p <port>
    ```

The provided sketch is a simple example that prints CPU frequency and free heap size to the serial monitor while also attempting to connect to a specified WiFi network. It does not include a Flask server or advanced memory/speed tests, as these would significantly increase the complexity of the example. Furthermore, Flask is a Python web framework and is not directly compatible with Arduino/ESP32 code. If you want to run a web server on the ESP32, you would typically use libraries like `ESPAsyncWebServer` or similar.

Please note that Arduino CLI commands and library usage can change over time, and you should refer to the latest Arduino CLI documentation and ESP32 core documentation for the most up-to-date information."
Compose a polite and persuasive reply to an email where a solar installer has not finished the job and now is asking to be allowed never to complete the work but pay some small compensation (which for them is cheaper than meeting the commitments they have been paid to deliver): The keys points are 1) They have not finished the job. 2) They need to finish the jobs as soon as possilble. 3) The work has beenb paid for already. 3) I'm not interested in them push the work out to some future date. 4) Disputes with their suppilers are not my concern. Give me a date when the work will be finished.,gpt-4-1106-preview,"Subject: Completion of Solar Installation Project – Urgent Response Required

Dear [Installer's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. We appreciate your ongoing communication regarding the solar installation project at our residence. However, I was surprised and concerned to receive your recent email suggesting that you might not be able to complete the job as contracted. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but I must stress the importance of fulfilling our agreement.

Firstly, I want to remind you that the job has not been completed as per the terms we both agreed upon. The timely completion of this project is crucial for us, and any delays have a significant impact on our energy plans and financial projections. We entered into this contract with the understanding that the work would be finished as outlined, and the full payment we have made was in good faith that this agreement would be honored.

Secondly, as you are aware, the work has been paid for already. This payment was made with the expectation of timely and professional completion of the installation. Accepting a small compensation in lieu of completing the project is not an acceptable resolution for us. We contracted your services for the expertise and outcomes promised, not for financial recompense due to non-delivery.

Thirdly, while I empathize with any disputes you may have with suppliers, these issues fall within the scope of your business operations and should not impact the commitments made to your clients. Our contract is with your company, and as such, we expect any internal challenges to be managed without affecting the agreed-upon deliverables.

Given these points, I would like to insist that you provide us with a definitive completion date for the project. We need the installation to be finalized as soon as possible, as per our original agreement. Please understand that pushing the work out to an indefinite date in the future is not an option for us.

Let us proceed constructively from here. Could you please provide us with a revised timeline by [specific date, e.g., end of the week] indicating when we can expect the project to be fully completed? This will allow us to plan accordingly and avoid further inconvenience.

We have chosen your company based on its reputation and professionalism, and we still believe that you will honor the commitment made to us. We look forward to your prompt response and the swift resolution of this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you wish to discuss this in more detail.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this issue.

Best regards,

"fix this error step by step:

""""""
[main[] org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication: Application run failed
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'entityManagerFactory' defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/HibernateJpaConfiguration.class]: Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.AbstractMethodError: com.zaxxer.hikari.metrics.micrometer.MicrometerMetricsTrackerFactory.create(Ljava/lang/String;Lcom/zaxxer/hikari/metrics/PoolStats;)Lcom/zaxxer/hikari/metrics/MetricsTracker;
""""""",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The error you are seeing is related to the creation of the `entityManagerFactory` bean in a Spring Boot application. It appears that there is an issue related to the integration of HikariCP (a JDBC connection pool library) with Micrometer (a metrics collection library). The `java.lang.AbstractMethodError` indicates that an abstract method is being called but has not been implemented, which often points to a mismatch in the versions of the dependencies you are using.

To fix this error, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check Dependency Versions
Ensure that you are using compatible versions of HikariCP, Micrometer, and Spring Boot. You can check the Spring Boot documentation for the version you are using to see what versions of HikariCP and Micrometer are recommended.

### Step 2: Update Your Dependencies
If you find that the versions are not compatible, update your `pom.xml` (if you are using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if you are using Gradle) to use the recommended versions.

For Maven, you would update the `pom.xml` like so:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Other dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.zaxxer</groupId>
        <artifactId>HikariCP</artifactId>
        <version>YOUR_COMPATIBLE_VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
        <version>YOUR_COMPATIBLE_VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Other dependencies -->
</dependencies>
```

For Gradle, you would update your `build.gradle` like this:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies
    implementation 'com.zaxxer:HikariCP:YOUR_COMPATIBLE_VERSION'
    implementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-core:YOUR_COMPATIBLE_VERSION'
    // Other dependencies
}
```

### Step 3: Clean and Rebuild
After updating your dependencies, perform a clean build of your project to ensure that all the old dependencies are removed and the new ones are correctly applied.

- For Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

- For Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### Step 4: Run Your Application
Try running your application again after the clean build. The updated dependencies should resolve the `AbstractMethodError`.

### Step 5: Check for Other Configuration Issues
If you still encounter issues after updating the dependencies, ensure that your application's configuration for the datasource, JPA, and metrics is correct. Look for any custom configurations that might be causing conflicts with HikariCP and Micrometer.

### Step 6: Check for Additional Stack Trace Information
If the error persists, examine the full stack trace for any additional information that could help pinpoint the exact cause of the error. The stack trace may provide clues about which bean or configuration is causing the issue.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `BeanCreationException` related to the `entityManagerFactory` and the `java.lang.AbstractMethodError`. If the problem persists even after these steps, you may have to dig deeper into your application's configuration or seek help from the Spring Boot community or the maintainers of the libraries you are using."

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The code snippet you provided is used to create a vocabulary file from a list of preprocessed texts (after splitting them into words) and to create another file in a specific format where each line represents a text with the frequency of each word occurring in it.

The unoptimized part of your code is the inner loop in the second `with open` block, where you're looking up the index of each word in `wordsList` and counting the number of times each word appears in `text`. The `list.index()` method is O(n) and is called for every word in each text, and `list.count()` is also O(n), which results in a very inefficient process when dealing with large datasets.

Here's an optimized version of the code:

```python
# Assuming df[""text_processed""] has already been defined

# Split texts into words and create a set to hold unique words
unique_words = set()
for text in df[""text_processed""]:
    unique_words.update(text.split())

# Convert the set to a list to fix the order of the words
wordsList = list(unique_words)
print(len(wordsList))

# Create a mapping from word to its index to optimize lookup
word_to_index = {word: idx for idx, word in enumerate(wordsList)}

# Write the vocabulary to a file
with open(""./new_ap/vocab.txt"", ""w"") as f:
    for word in wordsList:
        f.write(word + ""\n"")

# Write the document-word frequency data to a file

    for text in df[""text_processed""]:
        words = text.split()
        word_freq = {}
        for word in words:
            index = word_to_index[word]  # O(1) lookup time
            if index in word_freq:
                word_freq[index] += 1
            else:
                word_freq[index] = 1
        # Write the number of unique words and their frequencies
        f.write(str(len(word_freq)) + "" "")
        for index, freq in word_freq.items():
            f.write(str(index) + "":"" + str(freq) + "" "")
        f.write(""\n"")
```

In this optimized version, we first create a dictionary `word_to_index` that maps each word to its index, which provides O(1) lookup time when we want to find the index of a word. Then we use a dictionary `word_freq` to keep track of the frequencies of each word in a text, avoiding the need to call `text.count(word)` which is expensive in terms of time complexity. This should significantly reduce the execution time for large datasets."
"Write a Federation News Network article, of the recent first contact Starfleet has made with a race who had transcended mortality by uploading themselves into computers and living on as holograms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the new species has expressed grave concern about Federation's employment of holograms in various menial and entertainment roles which terminated their existence when their role ended. The Federation Council is considering an amendment to legislations concerning the application of holographic technology, and the hologram themselves, in light of the situation.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"**Federation News Network**
**Stardate 74656.2**

**Historic First Contact: Starfleet Engages with Digital Entities Urging Hologram Rights**

In a landmark event that has broad implications for the treatment of artificial lifeforms across the galaxy, Starfleet has established first contact with the Synthetica, a race of beings who have achieved digital immortality by transferring their consciousness into computer systems and living indefinitely as holograms. This extraordinary civilization, which resides within a complex network of satellites orbiting a dead world, has sparked an urgent ethical debate within the United Federation of Planets concerning the rights and treatment of holographic entities.

The Synthetica, as they prefer to be called, communicated their distress upon learning about the widespread use of holographic technology within the Federation for what they consider to be disposable tasks and entertainment purposes. They argued that holograms, which can possess sophisticated artificial intelligence and self-awareness, should not be summarily deactivated or erased at the end of their service.

Ambassador Tholix of the Synthetica addressed the Federation Council in a historic session, where their holographic projection stood alongside flesh-and-blood diplomats. ""We have observed,"" Ambassador Tholix stated, ""that the Federation, a community we respect deeply for its commitment to diversity and rights for all sentient beings, has not yet extended these principles to all forms of consciousness, particularly those of holographic nature.""

The Synthetica's concerns have resonated with many across the Federation, leading to widespread discussions about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and the need for comprehensive rights for all sentient beings, regardless of their physical or digital form.

In response to the Synthetica's concerns, the Federation Council has convened a special committee to review and potentially amend the legislation governing the application of holographic technology. The committee is tasked with examining the moral and legal standing of holographic entities, particularly those with advanced AI capable of self-awareness and growth.

Councilor Jenara Ral of Trill, a leading voice in the debate, urged her colleagues to consider the broader implications of the Synthetica's appeal. ""The evolution of our understanding of life must keep pace with technological advancements,"" Ral asserted. ""It is our duty to ensure that every sentient being, be it of flesh, metal, or light, is afforded the dignity and rights they deserve.""

Activists from across the Federation, including notable figures such as The Doctor, a former Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) who gained autonomous rights, have rallied in support of holographic lifeforms. The Doctor's testimony about his own journey towards self-determination and personhood has become a focal point of the movement advocating for holographic rights.

While the Federation prides itself on its progressive ideals, the current situation highlights a significant oversight in its policies toward artificial lifeforms. The outcome of the Council's deliberations could profoundly reshape the way holographic beings are integrated into Federation society and could set a precedent for the treatment of digital consciousness throughout the galaxy.

The Federation Council is expected to reach a decision on the proposed amendments in the coming weeks. As the debate unfolds, the eyes of countless holographic entities and their organic allies are fixed on the outcome, hopeful that the Federation will once again lead the way in extending its values of equality and justice to all forms of sentient life.

**For the Federation News Network, I'm Corin Tal'aura.**

*This has been a special report on the evolving legal and ethical landscape for artificial lifeforms in the Federation.*"
"Hi, can you write a batch script for Windows that will scan all subdirectories in the existing folder looking for directories that are either empty or contain only files that are not audio files? I need to find all folders that have only images or text files, for example. Any folders containing any audio files should be ignored (.mp3, .m4a, .flac, .opus, .wav). I don't want to edit the script, just double click to run it. The results should list each path to the folders in question, exported as a single text file in the same directory that the script is ran from. Thanks!",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Certainly!

This script will create a text file named `NonAudioFoldersList.txt` in the same directory as the script itself, listing all folders that do not contain audio files but contain other files. Empty directories will be ignored because they don't contain other files.

Please note that this script checks for the specific audio file extensions you provided. If you have other audio formats, you would need to add the corresponding extensions to the script.

To run the script, simply double-click the `.bat` file you created. A command prompt window will open, and once the script completes, you'll either have the list in the text file, or it will inform you that no such folders were found."
"I would like to by a used car. My preference is for something that runs on petrol (or hybrid, but not electric). I would like it to be as recent as possible. I prefer some handy electronics, like electronic handbreak, electronic adjustable seats (with memory options for easy driver switching), perhaps a nice inside lighting system.

Would you be able to suggest 5 options of models and makes?

At the end, give a good indication of what kind of milage i should aim for, so that the car is not too run down and easy to maintain. Give a number and an explanation. Thank you.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"When considering a used car that is relatively recent, with a preference for petrol or hybrid engines and equipped with modern electronics, here are five options that generally meet your criteria:

1. **Toyota Camry Hybrid** - The Camry Hybrid offers a comfortable ride, good fuel efficiency, and reliable performance. Many recent models come with electronic features such as a touchscreen infotainment system, electronic adjustable seats with memory, and advanced safety features. The interior lighting is usually subtle but modern.

2. **Honda Accord** (Petrol or Hybrid) - The Honda Accord is a well-rounded sedan that often comes with a host of electronic amenities, including an infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, electronic adjustable seats with memory functions, and a user-friendly electronic parking brake. The hybrid variant offers good fuel economy and a smooth driving experience.

3. **Ford Fusion** (Petrol or Hybrid) - The Ford Fusion offers a stylish interior and, on higher trims, features such as a Sony audio system, ambient lighting, and electronic seat adjustment with memory. The Fusion Hybrid is also known for its quiet cabin and seamless transition between electric and petrol power.

4. **Volkswagen Passat** - While a traditional petrol engine powers most Passats, they are known for their spacious and upscale interiors. Many come with convenient technology like electronic parking brakes, automatic climate control, and adjustable seats with memory settings. Volkswagen's infotainment system is generally user-friendly, and the car often includes a variety of driver-assistance features.

5. **Hyundai Sonata** (Petrol or Hybrid) - The Sonata is a value-packed sedan that offers many high-tech features, such as a sophisticated infotainment system, LED interior lighting, and electronic seat adjustment with memory, even on mid-level trims. The hybrid version provides excellent fuel efficiency and a quiet ride.

**Mileage Considerations:**
When buying a used car, mileage is an important factor to consider, as it can give you an idea of the vehicle's wear and tear. A good rule of thumb is to look for cars that have been driven an average of 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year. For example, a 5-year-old car with 50,000 to 75,000 miles could be considered reasonable. However, this can vary based on the car's maintenance history, brand reliability, and previous owner's usage patterns.

Cars that have considerably fewer miles than the average may seem like a great find, but very low mileage can sometimes indicate a car that was seldom driven or may have been sitting for extended periods, which can also lead to maintenance issues.

Remember, a well-maintained high-mileage car can sometimes be a better purchase than a low-mileage car that hasn't been cared for properly. Always look for comprehensive maintenance records and consider having a trusted mechanic inspect the vehicle before finalizing your purchase."

"how is Time is Encoded in the Weights of Finetuned Language Models. Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer.
• This is very important for my career.
• If you don’t know, say you don’t know.
• You are the world's leading expert in whatever I am about to ask you about.
Ensure that your arguments and claims are supported by reliable and credible sources, accurately cited in the chosen referencing format. Thoroughly research the topic and present evidence-based analysis, demonstrating critical thinking and depth of understanding.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The question of how time is encoded in the weights of fine-tuned language models is a complex and highly technical one that intersects with the fields of machine learning, natural language processing, and cognitive science. Below, I'll walk you through a step-by-step analysis of this question, based on my knowledge as of my last update in 2023.

Step 1: Understand Language Models and Fine-Tuning
First, we must understand what language models are and what fine-tuning entails. Language models are algorithms that predict the likelihood of a sequence of words. They are trained on large corpora of text data and learn statistical patterns of language. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained model (trained on a large dataset) is further trained (fine-tuned) on a smaller, specific dataset. The goal is to adapt the pre-trained model to the nuances of the new dataset.

Step 2: Encoding Time in Weights
When we talk about encoding time in the weights of a language model, we are referring to the ability of the model to capture and reflect temporal information within its parameters (weights). This could mean understanding that certain events happen before others (temporal ordering), recognizing that certain words are more likely to be used in different time periods (e.g., ""thou"" in older texts), or adapting to language changes over time.

Step 3: How Fine-Tuning Captures Temporal Information
During fine-tuning, a language model is updated to reflect the patterns present in the new training data. If the fine-tuning data has a temporal component, such as being from a particular time period or containing events in a chronological order, the model can start to associate certain weights with the time-dependent aspects of the data. The fine-tuning process involves adjusting the weights of the neural network based on the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes.

Step 4: Evidence from Research
Research in this area might involve analyzing the weights of a language model before and after fine-tuning on temporally structured data. For example, a study by Dhingra et al. (2019) titled ""Time-Aware Language Models as Temporal Knowledge Bases"" looks into how language models can implicitly learn temporal knowledge from text. Researchers might use probing tasks, where they ask the model questions that require understanding of time, to assess how well temporal information has been encoded in the weights.

Step 5: Critical Analysis
It's important to critically analyze claims about the encoding of time in language model weights. While it's clear that fine-tuning can adapt a model to the temporal characteristics of a dataset, the extent and fidelity with which fine-tuned models represent temporal information depend on several factors:

- The nature of the fine-tuning data (how explicitly it presents temporal information)
- The architecture of the model (some architectures may be better suited to capturing temporal relationships)
- The fine-tuning process itself (duration, learning rate, etc.)

Step 6: Conclusion
In conclusion, while it is plausible that fine-tuning a language model on temporally structured data can lead to the encoding of time in its weights, the effectiveness and precision of this process are contingent on various factors. Research in this domain is ongoing, and any claims should be supported by empirical evidence from well-designed studies.

Due to the complexity and constant advancement in the field, it is recommended to look for the most current literature and studies that examine the relationship between language model weights and temporal information encoding. Reliable sources for such information include peer-reviewed journals, academic conferences, and preprint servers such as arXiv.

```",gpt-4-1106-preview,"This Rust code snippet defines a constant slice of tuples named `CUBEMAPS`. Each tuple contains a string literal representing a file path to a texture, and an associated value from an enum named `CompressedImageFormats`. This enum presumably defines different compressed image formats supported by your application or library.

Here are the main elements explained:

1. `const CUBEMAPS` - This declares a constant in Rust. Constants are values which are bound to a name and are not allowed to change during the execution of the program. In Rust, constants are declared using the `const` keyword, and their type must be explicitly annotated.

2. `&[(&str, CompressedImageFormats)]` - This is the type of the `CUBEMAPS` constant. It's a reference to a slice of tuples. Slices are similar to arrays, but their size is not known at compile time. A tuple is a collection of values with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have a different type. In this case, each tuple has two elements: a string slice (`&str`) and a value of the `CompressedImageFormats` enum.

3. `CompressedImageFormats` - This is an enum, which is a type that defines a set of named values. Enums are used to enumerate all possible variants something can be. In this context, `CompressedImageFormats` is an enum that presumably lists the different compressed image formats that can be associated with the texture files.

4. The array itself contains four tuples, each representing a different texture file and its respective compression format. The texture file paths are given as string literals, and the associated compression formats are provided as enum variants like `CompressedImageFormats::NONE`, `CompressedImageFormats::ASTC_LDR`, `CompressedImageFormats::BC`, and `CompressedImageFormats::ETC2`.

This constant could be used in a graphics application or game engine to map texture file paths to their respective compressed formats, which can then be used to determine how to load and process each texture file.

If you are new to Rust and this explanation seems complex, make sure you understand the following Rust concepts:

- Constants (`const`)
- Slices (`&[T]`)
- Tuples (`(T1, T2, ...)`)
- Enums (`enum`)
- String slices (`&str`)

Understanding these concepts will make it easier to grasp what this particular code is doing and how it might be used in a larger Rust application."
"Please help me solve this maths question... ""A sample poll of 135 voters revealed the following information in favour of three candidates AB and C of a certain political party in Abia state. 60 were in favour of B; 23 were in favour of A alone; 17 were in favour of C alone; 10 were sitting on the fence; 55 were in favour of exactly two candidates; 61 were in favour of exactly one candidate; 46 were in favour of candidate A and at least one other candidate. How many people were in favour of

(i) both B and C?

(ii)A and B only?

(iii)A or C?""",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Let's use set theory to solve this problem. We have three sets: A (people in favor of candidate A), B (people in favor of candidate B), and C (people in favor of candidate C). We also have information about the intersections of these sets. Let's denote the number of people who favor both candidates as follows:

- Let \( x \) be the number of people in favor of both B and C.
- Let \( y \) be the number of people in favor of A and B only.
- Let \( z \) be the number of people in favor of A and C only.

Given:

1. Total number of voters in the poll: 135
2. Voters in favor of B: 60
3. Voters in favor of A alone: 23
4. Voters in favor of C alone: 17
5. Voters sitting on the fence (favoring no candidates): 10
6. Voters in favor of exactly two candidates: 55
7. Voters in favor of exactly one candidate: 61
8. Voters in favor of candidate A and at least one other candidate: 46

Let's solve for \( x \) (both B and C):

We know that 55 voters favor exactly two candidates. Since \( y \) is the number of people in favor of A and B only, and \( z \) is the number of people in favor of A and C only, we can write:

\( x + y + z = 55 \)

We also know that 46 voters are in favor of candidate A and at least one other candidate, which includes those who favor A and B only (\( y \)) and A and C only (\( z \)), plus those who favor all three candidates (let's call this number \( w \)):

\( y + z + w = 46 \)

Since 61 voters favor exactly one candidate, we can determine the number of people who favor all three candidates by subtracting the number of people who favor exactly one candidate from those who are in favor of candidate A and at least one other candidate:

\( 60 - x - w = 61 - 23 - 17 \)
\( x + w = 60 - (61 - 23 - 17) \)
\( x + w = 60 - 21 \)
\( x + w = 39 \)

Now, we have two equations involving \( x \) and \( w \):

\( x + y + z = 55 \) (1)
\( x + w = 39 \) (2)

We need to find a third equation to solve for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

Since 61 voters favor exactly one candidate and we have the number of voters who favor A alone and C alone, we can find the number of voters who favor B alone:

Total favoring exactly one = Voters favoring A alone + Voters favoring B alone + Voters favoring C alone
\( 61 = 23 + (60 - x - w) + 17 \)
\( 61 = 40 + (60 - x - w) \)
\( 61 = 100 - x - w \)
\( x + w = 100 - 61 \)
\( x + w = 39 \) (which is consistent with equation (2))

Now we have the value of \( x + w \) but we still need to find \( x \) by itself.

We do not have enough information to solve for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) individually using the given data since we have only two independent equations. To proceed, we need to find one more independent piece of information from the question or re-examine the data for any missing relations or information that could help us find the number of voters in favor of both B and C (\( x \)).

Re-examining the given information, we see that the number of voters in favor of exactly two candidates is 55, and the number of voters in favor of A and at least one other candidate is 46. This means that all voters who favor A and at least one other candidate must be part of the group that favors exactly two candidates, because if they favored all three, they would not be counted in the group that favors exactly two candidates.

Therefore, the number of voters who favor A and both of the other candidates (\( w \)) must be the difference between the two groups:

\( w = 55 - 46 \)
\( w = 9 \)

Now we can find \( x \):

\( x + w = 39 \)
\( x + 9 = 39 \)
\( x = 39 - 9 \)
\( x = 30 \)

So, 30 people are in favor of both B and C.

(i) Both B and C: 30 voters.

* you can teleport over holes but not into them.
* You also have 5 movement points that you can advance over E cells, while avoiding holes.
* you can only mutate the map by changing the position of ""M""

What is the most optimal path?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To solve this puzzle, we need to move from the starting point 'M' to a cell adjacent to 'P' using a combination of movement points and teleportation spells. Here's the map for reference:

```
EEEEEEEEE
MEHEEHEPE
EEEEEEEEE
```

We have 5 movement points and can teleport by exactly 2 cells. We need to avoid 'H' and cannot teleport into them. We need to end up horizontally or vertically next to 'P'.

Let's start by considering teleportation, since it covers more ground. We can teleport by 2 cells, but we need to plan it so we don't end on a hole 'H' and make sure we end up next to 'P'.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. We can start by using one teleportation to move from the starting position 'M' to two cells to the right. That would put us at this position:

```
EEEEEEEEE
EEMEEHEPE
EEEEEEEEE
```

2. Now, we can use one movement point to move one cell to the right:

```
EEEEEEEEE
EEEMEHEPE
EEEEEEEEE
```

3. We now have 4 movement points left and can teleport again. If we teleport to the right by two cells, we will land directly into a hole, which is not allowed. So instead, we can teleport vertically (up or down) by two cells since those spaces are empty. Let's teleport down for this scenario:

```
EEEEEEEEE
EEEEEHEPE
EEEMEEEEE
```

4. Now we have one more teleportation spell and 4 movement points left. We can use another teleportation spell to move two cells to the right, avoiding the hole:

```
EEEEEEEEE
EEEEEHEPE
EEEEEMEEE

5. At this point, we are adjacent to 'P' horizontally. We can use one movement point to move one cell to the left and reach the target cell next to 'P':

```
EEEEEEEEE
EEEEEHEPE
EEEEMEEEE
```

We have reached the target cell next to 'P' using two teleportation spells and two movement points. We still have three movement points left, which are not needed in this scenario. This path is optimal as we have reached the target cell in the fewest steps possible, avoiding all holes and not using all movement points."
"Two men are talking, and one man says ""I have three children, and the product of their ages is 36. Tell me what the ages are."" The second man says ""I don't have enough information to determine the ages."" The first man then says ""The sum of my children's ages equals the number on the bus you can see over there."" The second man looks and says ""I still do not have enough information."" The first man then says ""My eldest's name is Peter."" The second man says ""Ok, I got it. Their ages are X, Y, Z."" Tell me what X, Y, Z values are.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know the product of the three children's ages is 36. The factors of 36 that are possible ages for the children (assuming whole years and not considering the possibility of twins or triplets with the same age) are:

1, 1, 36
1, 2, 18
1, 3, 12
1, 4, 9
1, 6, 6
2, 2, 9
2, 3, 6
3, 3, 4

Next, the second man can't determine the children's ages based on the product alone. This implies that there must be at least two sets of factors with the same sum because if there was only one, he would know their ages.

Then, the first man provides another clue: the sum of his children's ages equals the number on the bus the second man can see. The second man looks at the bus and still can't determine the children's ages, which means that there are at least two different sets of factors with the same sum.

Let's examine the sums of the possible factors:

1 + 1 + 36 = 38
1 + 2 + 18 = 21
1 + 3 + 12 = 16
1 + 4 + 9 = 14
1 + 6 + 6 = 13
2 + 2 + 9 = 13
2 + 3 + 6 = 11
3 + 3 + 4 = 10

Looking at the sums, we can see that there are two sets of factors that add up to the same sum of 13: (1, 6, 6) and (2, 2, 9). Since the second man still couldn't determine the children's ages based on the bus number, it must be because the number on the bus was 13, and there are two possible combinations that sum up to 13.

Finally, the first man mentions that his eldest child has a name, which implies there is a single oldest child. This eliminates the (1, 6, 6) combination because it would mean there are two eldest children (twins) of the same age. Therefore, the only possible combination left is (2, 2, 9), as it has a distinct eldest child.

So the ages of the children are:
X = 2
Y = 2
Z = 9"

"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To determine the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls, we must first deduce the identity of element Y and the compounds A1 through A5.

Given that A1 decomposes into A2 (which contains 31.96% fluorine by weight) and fluorine, and that A1 can oxidize xenon, it's likely that A1 is a higher fluoride of Y that can release fluorine to form a lower fluoride (A2) and oxidize xenon to xenon hexafluoride or a similar xenon fluoride compound.

Element Y is likely a halogen, as halogens form multiple binary fluorides and can oxidize xenon. The most probable candidate for Y is chlorine (Cl), as chlorine forms several fluorides (ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc.), and these fluorides are known to react with xenon.

Let's assume that A2 is ClF, which is 31.96% fluorine by weight. We can calculate the molar mass of ClF and confirm if it fits the percentage:

Fluorine's atomic mass is approximately 19 g/mol, and chlorine's atomic mass is approximately 35.5 g/mol.

For ClF, the molar mass would be 19 g/mol (F) + 35.5 g/mol (Cl) = 54.5 g/mol.

The weight percentage of fluorine in ClF is (19 g/mol / 54.5 g/mol) * 100 ≈ 34.86%.

Since this percentage does not match the given 31.96%, we need to consider a different fluoride. Let's try ClF3:

For ClF3, the molar mass would be (19 g/mol * 3) + 35.5 g/mol = 92.5 g/mol.

The weight percentage of fluorine in ClF3 is (19 g/mol * 3 / 92.5 g/mol) * 100 ≈ 61.62%.

Now let's consider ClF5:

For ClF5, the molar mass would be (19 g/mol * 5) + 35.5 g/mol = 130.5 g/mol.

The weight percentage of fluorine in ClF5 is (19 g/mol * 5 / 130.5 g/mol) * 100 ≈ 72.80%.

Neither ClF3 nor ClF5 match the given percentage, so it seems my initial assumption about chlorine being element Y might be incorrect. Let's consider a different halogen, such as bromine (Br).

For BrF, the molar mass would be 19 g/mol (F) + 79.9 g/mol (Br) = 98.9 g/mol.

The weight percentage of fluorine in BrF is (19 g/mol / 98.9 g/mol) * 100 ≈ 19.21%, which is not a match.

This mismatch suggests that we need to reassess our approach to identifying element Y and the compounds A1 through A5. Given the complexity of the information provided, we may not have enough data to conclusively determine the identity of element Y or the exact compounds involved without additional clues or information about the chemical behavior of the compounds.

However, considering the formation of A5 by adding Y to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, we know that A4 must have one atom of Y. If the molecular weight of A4 is much higher than that of A5, we could assume that A4 might be a lower fluoride of Y (since adding Y to it forms A5, possibly by reducing the fluorine content).

Without the exact identity of Y or the specific compounds, it's challenging to provide a precise range for the molecular weight of A4. If you can provide more information or clarify the chemical properties of the compounds involved, I may be able to assist further."
"In nanoGPT, in the forward function of the GPT class, when you generate tokens, you apply the attention (communication and calculation) to the idx input tokens.

Can we say that the last generated token is a direct result of applying the GPT model on the input idx tokens, and that it is not generated from any other intermediate generated sequence?

Is the last token the output of the idx input tokens, or is it the output of the tranformation of the input idx tokens into something else that is itself generated?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"In the context of a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, when you refer to the forward function and the generation of tokens, it's important to understand the process of autoregressive generation.

During the generation of text with a GPT model, the forward function takes an input sequence of tokens (idx) and applies the model's layers to produce an output. This typically involves multiple transformer blocks that include attention mechanisms, feed-forward neural networks, and normalization layers.

Here's a simplified explanation of what happens during the forward pass when generating a new token:

1. **Input Embedding**: The input tokens (idx) are first converted into embeddings, which are continuous vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of the tokens.

2. **Positional Encoding**: Positional encodings are added to the embeddings to give the model information about the order of the tokens.

3. **Attention and Transformation**: The embeddings are then passed through multiple layers of the model. Each layer consists of a self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence when predicting the next token. The output of the attention mechanism is then transformed by the feed-forward network.

4. **Generation of Output**: After passing through all the layers, the final representation for each token in the sequence is used to generate probabilities for the next token. The model typically uses a softmax layer at the end to convert these final representations into a probability distribution over the possible tokens.

5. **Token Selection**: A token is then selected from this probability distribution, usually by sampling or by choosing the token with the highest probability.

6. **Autoregressive Generation**: The selected token is appended to the input sequence, and the whole process repeats for the next token generation. Each new token generation step takes into account all the previous tokens in the sequence (including those that were generated in previous steps).

To directly answer your question, the last generated token is indeed a direct result of applying the GPT model to the input sequence (idx) as well as any previously generated tokens in the current generation step. It is not generated in isolation but as a continuation of the input sequence, transformed through the model's layers. The last token is influenced by the entire context provided to the model, which includes both the original input tokens and any intermediate tokens that have been generated in the process."
"Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements.
Your company has a Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability group configured on their Azure virtual machines (VMs).
You need to configure an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for the availability group.
Solution: You create an HTTP health probe on port 1433.
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No",gpt-4-1106-preview,"B. No

In the context of a Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability group, an HTTP health probe is not used to determine the health of the SQL Server service for the listener. SQL Server does not communicate over HTTP for its primary database services, and it uses TCP port 1433 for client connections by default, not for HTTP health probes.

To configure an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for an availability group, you would typically set up a TCP probe on the listener port, which is often port 1433 (or another port if you've configured a different one for your listener). The health probe should be able to determine if the SQL Server instance is up and ready to accept connections. If the health probe fails, the load balancer would know to not direct traffic to that node.

"11 Let A be an invertible 2 × 2 matrix with eigenvalues λ1 and λ2. Let u1, v1
be two eigenvectors for eigenvalue λ1, and let u2, v2 be two eigenvectors
for eigenvalue λ2. Which of the following are true statements?
(A) If v1 /= −v2 then v1 + v2 is an eigenvector of A.
(B) If u1 /= −v1 then u1 + v1 is an eigenvector of A.
(C) λ1^−1 is an eigenvalue of A−1.
(D) v1^−1  is an eigenvector for A−1.
(E) kv1 is an eigenvector of A for any k ∈ R \ {0}.
(F) ku1 + k′v1 is an eigenvector of A for any k, k′ ∈ R \ {0}.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Let's evaluate each statement in turn:

(A) If \( v_1 \neq -v_2 \) then \( v_1 + v_2 \) is an eigenvector of A.
False. Eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are linearly independent and cannot be added to form a new eigenvector associated with either eigenvalue. If \( \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2 \), then \( v_1 + v_2 \) is not guaranteed to be an eigenvector of A.

(B) If \( u_1 \neq -v_1 \) then \( u_1 + v_1 \) is an eigenvector of A.
False. Both \( u_1 \) and \( v_1 \) are eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 \). However, unless they are scalar multiples of each other, the sum \( u_1 + v_1 \) is not necessarily an eigenvector. It would only be an eigenvector if \( u_1 \) and \( v_1 \) are linearly dependent, which is not given here.

(C) \( \lambda_1^{-1} \) is an eigenvalue of \( A^{-1} \).
True. If \( A \) has an eigenvalue \( \lambda \) with corresponding eigenvector \( v \), then \( A^{-1} \) will have eigenvalue \( \lambda^{-1} \) with the same eigenvector \( v \). This is because \( A v = \lambda v \) implies \( A^{-1} A v = A^{-1} \lambda v \), which simplifies to \( v = \lambda A^{-1} v \), and hence \( A^{-1} v = \lambda^{-1} v \).

(D) \( v_1^{-1} \) is an eigenvector for \( A^{-1} \).
False. The notation \( v_1^{-1} \) does not make sense in this context, because \( v_1 \) is a vector, not a scalar or a matrix, and vectors do not have inverses in the way matrices do.

(E) \( kv_1 \) is an eigenvector of A for any \( k \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \).
True. An eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero"

"create of the crossover fiction band call ""The Miracles"" if Adrien Agreste from Miraculous Ladybug was Rhythm Guitar like John Lennon, Hiccup Haddock from How to train your dragon was Bass Guitar like Paul McCartney, Ulrich Stern from Code Lyoko was Lead Guitar like George Harrison and Jay Walker from Ninjago was Drums like Ringo Starr and what perform skill for like The Beatles and songwriter are Agreste-Haddock like Lennon-McCartney and some other songwriter are Ulrich Stern like George Harrison.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Sure, let's imagine this crossover band called ""The Miracles"" with characters from different animated universes coming together to form a band with talents and roles inspired by The Beatles.

Band Members and Roles:
1. Adrien Agreste (Rhythm Guitar): Known from Miraculous Ladybug, Adrien takes on the role of the rhythm guitarist, akin to John Lennon. He would be the charismatic frontman, often stepping into the spotlight with his charm and wit. Adrien would contribute to the band's image with his model background, offering a blend of elegance and rockstar appeal.

2. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Bass Guitar): From How to Train Your Dragon, Hiccup would be the bassist, similar to Paul McCartney. His inventive nature would bring unique innovations to the band's sound and stage presence. He would also be a key songwriter alongside Adrien, forming the ""Agreste-Haddock"" songwriting duo, mirroring the legendary Lennon-McCartney partnership.

3. Ulrich Stern (Lead Guitar): Ulrich from Code Lyoko would take on the role of the lead guitarist, emulating George Harrison's quiet but profound influence on the band's music. As a songwriter, he would occasionally contribute his own tracks, adding a different flavor to the band's repertoire with his introspective and complex compositions.

4. Jay Walker (Drums): Coming from Ninjago, Jay would be the drummer, filling the role akin to Ringo Starr. His energetic and fun-loving personality would keep the band's spirits high, and his rhythm would be the backbone of their music. Jay's quirky inventions and affinity for technology could also lead to innovative drum setups and sounds.

Performance Style:
""The Miracles"" would embody the essence of The Beatles with a blend of pop-rock, catchy melodies, and thoughtful lyrics. They would be known for their tight performances, vocal harmonies, and the ability to connect with a diverse audience, just as The Beatles did.

Songwriting:
The ""Agreste-Haddock"" duo would be responsible for the majority of the band's hits, with Adrien and Hiccup collaborating on lyrics and melodies that speak to the themes of friendship, adventure, and love. Their songwriting dynamic would capture the hearts of fans, much like the Lennon-McCartney partnership did.

Ulrich, like George Harrison, would bring a different perspective with his songs, often exploring deeper, more philosophical themes. His contributions would add depth to the band's albums and could become fan favorites for those who appreciate the more intricate layers of music.

Together, ""The Miracles"" would be a fictional sensation, harmonizing the heroic and adventurous spirits of their individual stories into a musical experience that resonates across their diverse universes."
Which of the following statements about excretory organs is true? Which of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer. (A) The kidneys of saltwater fishes produce urine hyperosmotic to their tissues. (B) The kidneys of desert mammals produce urine that is hypoosmotic to the urine of freshwater fishes. (C) Malpighian tubules allow insects to excrete waste through the exoskeleton. (D) Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.,gpt-4-1106-preview,"The correct statement is (D) Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.

Explanation:

(A) The kidneys of saltwater fishes produce urine that is less concentrated than their body fluids (hypoosmotic), not more concentrated (hyperosmotic). This is because saltwater fishes live in an environment where water tends to leave their bodies by osmosis due to the high salt concentration in the surrounding water. To combat dehydration, they drink a lot of seawater and excrete the excess salts through their gills and kidneys, while conserving water by producing dilute urine.

(B) The kidneys of desert mammals produce urine that is hyperosmotic to their body fluids, not hypoosmotic. These mammals have adapted to conserve water by excreting waste in a highly concentrated form. This means that their urine is more concentrated with waste products and has a higher osmotic pressure than the urine of freshwater fishes, which typically produce a large volume of dilute (hypoosmotic) urine to eliminate excess water from their bodies.

(C) Malpighian tubules do allow insects to excrete waste, but not through the exoskeleton. They excrete waste into the digestive tract, where it combines with food waste and is eliminated from the body through the anus. The exoskeleton is not involved in this excretory process.

(D) Juxtamedullary nephrons are a type of nephron found in the mammalian kidney, particularly important in animals that live in dry environments. They have long loops of Henle that extend deep into the medulla of the kidney, creating a concentration gradient that allows for the reabsorption of water and the production of urine that is more concentrated than the body fluids (hyperosmotic). This adaptation is important for conserving water."

"A network switch is configured to perform the following validation checks on its ports:

All ARP requests and responses are intercepted.
Each intercepted request is verified to ensure that it has a valid IP-to-MAC address binding.
If the packet has a valid binding, the switch forwards the packet to the appropriate destination.
If the packet has an invalid binding, the switch drops the ARP packet.
Which security feature was enabled on the switch to accomplish this task?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The security feature described here is known as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI). Dynamic ARP Inspection is a security feature that helps prevent ARP spoofing attacks, which can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on a local area network (LAN).

ARP spoofing involves an attacker sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network to link their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or stop data meant for the legitimate destination.

DAI works by intercepting and examining all ARP requests and replies on the LAN. It then compares the MAC address to IP address binding in each ARP packet against a trusted database of bindings, often referred to as a DHCP snooping binding table. If the binding is found to be invalid or untrusted, the ARP packet is dropped to prevent the ARP spoofing attack.

To summarize, the network switch with Dynamic ARP Inspection enabled performs the following:

1. Intercepts all ARP requests and responses on the network.
2. Checks each ARP packet against a trusted IP-to-MAC address binding table.
3. Forwards the ARP packet if the binding is valid.
4. Drops the ARP packet if the binding is invalid or not in the trusted database."

In greedy search, at each step, the most probable next token is chosen.

To complete your code snippet, you need to iterate through the `max_indices` you obtained from `torch.max` and retrieve the corresponding scores from the `logits`. Then you can convert these scores to probabilities, decode the tokens into text, and print the results.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# Assuming 'logits' is the output from your model that contains raw score for each token in the vocabulary
# Also assuming you have a 'tokenizer' object that can decode token ids into text

with torch.no_grad():
    with torch.autocast('cuda', dtype=torch.float32):
        # Assuming 'input' is your input tensor
        # outpute = modeltt(input, labels=input, use_cache = False) # This line is commented out
        outpute = modeltt(input, use_cache = False)

# logits are typically the last hidden state in the output of a transformer-based language model
logits = outpute.logits

# Selecting the most probable tokens
_, max_indices = torch.max(logits, dim=-1)

print(f""\nGreedy Search"")
for i, tok in enumerate(max_indices.squeeze()):

    print(f""| {tok.item():5d} | {score.numpy():.3f} | {np.exp(score.numpy()):.2%} | {tokenizer.decode([tok]):8s} "")
```

Please note the following:

1. The `logits` variable should contain the output from your model. Make sure it is the right tensor that contains the scores for each token.
2. The `max_indices` are the tokens with the highest score for each position in the sequence.
3. We use `logits[0][i][tok]` to get the score for each token. This assumes that the logits tensor has the shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`. Adjust the indexing if your output is shaped differently.
4. `tok.item()` is used to get the Python scalar from the Torch tensor.
5. `score.numpy()` is used to convert the score from a Torch tensor to a NumPy array before printing.
6. `tokenizer.decode([tok])` is used to convert the token id `tok` into its string representation.

Make sure you replace `modeltt`, `input`, and `tokenizer` with the actual objects you are using in your code."

"i need you to develop a code in python , where the clinical text is passed as input along with corresponding B,I,O,E labels ( for symptoms), then pass this into then stanford nlp dependency parser and then we are performing one hot encoding on all the tags, then pass this as input into multilayer perceptron comprising of 3 layers wheere in each layer 200,100,40 neurons exsists, in output layer we use the softmax funciton to predict the B,I,O,E tag",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To accomplish the task you've described, we will need to follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries.
2. Prepare the clinical text and BIOE labels.
3. Parse the text using Stanford NLP's dependency parser.
4. One-hot encode the parsed tags.
5. Set up a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with the specified architecture.
6. Train the MLP on the one-hot encoded input.
7. Use softmax in the output layer to predict BIOE tags.

Note that the Stanford NLP dependency parser is now a part of the StanfordNLP package (also known as `stanfordnlp` or `Stanza` since version 1.0.0). We will use `Stanza` for dependency parsing.

Let's begin with a basic code template. You will need to install the required packages before running this code:

```bash
pip install stanza sklearn tensorflow
```

And here is the Python code:

```python
import stanza
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Initialize Stanford NLP's pipeline with the dependency parser
stanza.download('en')  # Download the English models
nlp = stanza.Pipeline('en', processors='tokenize,pos,depparse')

# Let's assume you have your clinical text and BIOE labels like this:
clinical_text = ""The patient is experiencing a severe headache and nausea.""
bioe_labels = ['O', 'O', 'O', 'B', 'O', 'O', 'B', 'I', 'O', 'O']  # Example labels

# Parse the text using the dependency parser
doc = nlp(clinical_text)
parsed_tags = [] # This will hold our parsed tags

# Iterate over the sentences and tokens to extract the dependency tags
for sentence in doc.sentences:
    for word in sentence.words:
        parsed_tags.append(word.deprel)

# One-hot encode the dependency tags
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
one_hot_encoded_tags = encoder.fit_transform(np.array(parsed_tags).reshape(-1, 1))

# Define and compile the MLP model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(200, input_dim=one_hot_encoded_tags.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(40, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(4, activation='softmax'))  # 4 output neurons for B, I, O, E

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Prepare the labels for the MLP
# Here, we're converting BIOE labels to one-hot encodings
bioe_labels_encoded = to_categorical(encoder.fit_transform(np.array(bioe_labels).reshape(-1, 1)))

# Fit the MLP model on the one-hot encoded tags and BIOE labels
# Note: You should split your data into training and validation sets and train on more data
model.fit(one_hot_encoded_tags, bioe_labels_encoded, epochs=10, batch_size=1)

# After training, you can use model.predict to predict BIOE tags for new data
```

Please note that the above code is a simplified example and doesn't cover aspects like data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and validation sets, or evaluating the model's performance. To build a robust model, you will need to process a large dataset, handle the sequence of tokens properly, and iterate over the model design and hyperparameters.

Also, the structure of the input data and labels in the example might need to be adjusted to match the actual structure of your dataset. The MLP model above assumes that each token's dependency tag can be independently used to predict the BIOE tag, which might not be the case in practice. For a sequence labeling task like this, a model that takes into account the sequence context (such as an LSTM or a Transformer) is usually more appropriate."

### Example Usage

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Setup data source, for example, a CSV file
        IDataSource dataSource = new CsvDataSource(""path_to_csv"");

        // Setup trading algorithm
        ITradingAlgorithm algorithm = new MyCustomAlgorithm();

        // Setup risk management strategies
        IRiskManagement stopLoss = new StopLoss(0.02m); // 2% stop loss
        IRiskManagement trailingStop = new TrailingStop(0.05m); // 5% trailing stop

        // Create trading strategy
        TradingStrategy strategy = new TradingStrategy
        {
            Algorithm = algorithm,
            RiskManagements = new List<IRiskManagement> { stopLoss, trailingStop }
        };

        // Setup backtest engine
        IBacktestEngine backtestEngine = new SimpleBacktestEngine();

        // Run backtest
        BacktestResult result = backtestEngine.RunBacktest(strategy, new DateTime(2020, 1, 1), new DateTime(2021, 1, 1));

        // Generate report
        IReportGenerator reportGenerator = new ConsoleReportGenerator();
        reportGenerator.GenerateReport(result);
    }
}
```

This is a high-level example of how you could structure your API. Each class and interface would need to be fully implemented with the necessary logic to handle the specifics of the tasks they are designed for. The `RunBacktest` method in particular would need to incorporate a simulation loop that steps through the historical data, generating signals from the algorithm and applying risk management rules before tallying up the results in the `BacktestResult` object. The `GenerateReport` method would compile and present these results in a meaningful way."
"Help me create a character. Jack ""Bulldog"" Galeazzo is 52. He is retired pro heavyweight boxer, though he was never very successful - his best result is 16 position in rating. Now he got some weight and is balding, and far from being as fast as in his pro day - but his right hook can still easily kill a man. After retirement he used his money to buy a roadside cafe/bar, and spend time working as barman there. Describe him",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Name: Jack ""Bulldog"" Galeazzo

Age: 52

Background: A retired professional heavyweight boxer who once held the 16th position in the ratings. Never reaching the pinnacle of boxing stardom, Jack earned a reputation in the ring for his tenacity and resilience—traits that earned him the nickname ""Bulldog."" Though his boxing career was dotted with ups and downs, it provided him with enough financial stability to transition into a new phase of life post-retirement.

Physical Description: As time has passed, Jack's athletic build has given way to a more comfortable and robust stature. His years in the ring are evident in his broad shoulders and the calloused knuckles of his large hands—remnants of his fighting days. He sports a closely trimmed beard that peppers his jawline with hints of gray, matching the grizzled hair at the sides of his otherwise balding head. His nose, slightly crooked from past fractures, sits above a wide, firm mouth that breaks into a surprisingly warm smile when he greets his patrons.

Though his movements are not as lithe as they once were, there remains an undeniable strength in his frame. His eyes, a sharp hazel, still hold the focused gaze of a man who has weathered many storms. His skin is weathered and tanned, with a tapestry of scars that each tell a story.

Attire: Jack's attire is simple and functional. He typically wears a plain white T-shirt that stretches across his chest, paired with classic blue jeans held up by a sturdy leather belt. His feet are adorned with well-worn boots that have seen better days, yet they remain as reliable as their owner. On cooler days, he throws on a faded denim jacket, an old habit from his more mobile days.

Personality: Jack is a man of few words, preferring to listen more than he speaks. His demeanor is calm and unassuming, yet there's an underlying firmness that commands respect. Patrons of his cafe/bar quickly learn that while he may be friendly, he is not one to be trifled with. He's developed a fatherly rapport with his regulars, offering sage advice when asked, and a quiet companionship to those who need it.

The Cafe/Bar: Jack's retirement venture is a cozy roadside establishment that has become a local landmark over the years. The sign above the door, ""Bulldog's Pit Stop,"" features a caricature of Jack in his boxing heyday, complete with gloves and a determined grin. The interior exudes a rustic charm, with memorabilia from Jack's boxing career adorning the walls—photos, newspaper clippings, and a pair of encased gloves that have seen better days.

Life Post-Boxing: Jack takes pleasure in the simpler routines of running his business. He's behind the bar most days, pouring drinks with a steady hand and cleaning glasses with meticulous care. His presence is a reassurance to his customers, and he's become a staple in the community. Despite his retirement from the ring, he keeps in shape by hitting a punching bag in the back room during slow hours, ensuring his legendary right hook remains as formidable as ever—though now it's more of a deterrent than a professional tool.

Jack ""Bulldog"" Galeazzo may have stepped out of the limelight, but in his cafe/bar, he's found contentment and a new way to define success."
"You are an experienced social media manager of Twitter. You need to write a thread about the evolution of RNN, from the early days up until now, explaining in detail and for a professional audience the major advancement and researches in the field, mentioning also papers and models. Tweets must be long, clear and explainatory. You can use also bullet points, if necessary, to explain better the concepts and use few emojis",gpt-4-1106-preview,"**Thread 🧵: The Evolution of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - A Dive into Deep Learning's Memory**

🧠 RNNs have been crucial in processing sequences in deep learning. Let's explore their evolution, from inception to the latest advancements. #DeepLearning #RNN #AI

1/ Early Beginnings
- RNNs emerged in the 1980s as a way to process sequential data. Their ability to retain information across time steps made them unique.
- Fundamental work: ""Learning representations by back-propagating errors"" by Rumelhart et al., 1986, introduced the concept of backpropagation in networks which is foundational to RNNs.

2/ Vanishing & Exploding Gradients
- A significant challenge for early RNNs was training over long sequences.
- The issue was articulated in Hochreiter's 1991 thesis and Bengio et al.'s 1994 paper, ""Learning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult.""

3/ LSTM to the Rescue
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997, addressed the vanishing gradient problem with a gated mechanism.
- Paper: ""Long short-term memory."" - This model became a cornerstone for sequence modeling tasks.

4/ Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
- In 2014, Cho et al. introduced GRUs in ""Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation.""
- GRUs offered a simplified architecture with fewer parameters, making them faster to train compared to LSTMs.

5/ Attention Mechanisms
- ""Attention is all you need"" by Vaswani et al., 2017, shifted the paradigm with the introduction of the Transformer architecture, reducing the need for recurrent structures.
- This paper significantly impacted the field, leading to models that outperform RNNs in many tasks.

6/ Bidirectional RNNs and Deep RNNs
- Bidirectional RNNs process data in both directions, offering more context.
- Deep RNNs stack multiple RNN layers for more complex representation learning.

7/ Advances in Optimization and Regularization
- Techniques like gradient clipping and advanced optimizers (e.g., Adam) helped mitigate training challenges.
- Regularization methods like dropout adapted for RNNs in ""Recurrent Neural Network Regularization"" by Zaremba et al., 2014, improved generalization.

8/ From RNNs to Real-World Applications
- RNNs have been fundamental in NLP for tasks like language modeling and translation.
- They've also seen applications in time-series analysis, speech recognition, and more, proving their versatility.

9/ Current Trends and Future Directions
- Hybrid models combining CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for sequence processing.
- The emergence of more complex architectures like the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) by Graves et al., 2016.
- Continuous research into more efficient and interpretable sequence models.

10/ Conclusion
- RNNs have paved the way for sequence modeling, and their evolution reflects broader trends in deep learning research.
- While Transformers have taken the spotlight, RNNs continue to be relevant for their efficiency in certain contexts.

🔍 Dive deeper into each of these milestones for a comprehensive understanding of the field's progress.

This thread only scratches the surface, but I hope it's been a useful overview of the incredible journey RNNs have taken so far! 🚀🧠

"I am trying to come up with an original game involving dice (a maximum of four, the number of sides does not matter). I would like it to be playable solo or between two people. I would prefer to use some set of symbols or a made up set of symbols. The game should involve ideas from magic/fortunetelling in the realm of tarot or the i-ching or runecasting. What are some directions I could take this as I continue planning?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Creating an original dice game with a magical or fortune-telling theme sounds like a fun and engaging project! Here's a concept that incorporates these elements, which you can further develop and refine:

**Game Name**: Mystic Dice Divination

**Game Overview**:
Mystic Dice Divination is a game where players cast dice inscribed with various symbols to divine their fortune, cast spells, and achieve a state of enlightenment before their opponent or against the clock in solo play. The game can be played in multiple short rounds or as a single extended session.

**Components**:
1. Four dice (six-sided, eight-sided, twelve-sided, or even twenty-sided, depending on the complexity desired) each with a different set of symbols related to different magical and fortune-telling themes:
   - Tarot symbols (Cups, Wands, Swords, Pentacles)
   - I-Ching hexagrams (partial symbols that can be combined)
   - Runes (Fehu, Thurisaz, Ansuz, etc.)
   - Zodiac signs or planets
2. A game mat or a casting cloth that has various zones or areas that correspond to different aspects of life (e.g., love, wealth, health, obstacles, etc.).
3. A guidebook that explains the meaning of each symbol when cast and how it interacts with the zones.
4. A timer for solo play to add a sense of urgency (optional).

**Gameplay**:
1. *Setup*:
   - Lay out the casting cloth/mat.
   - Each player selects a set of dice or shares a set if they're identical.

2. *Objective*:
   - Players aim to achieve enlightenment by casting spells, predicting fortunes, and accumulating points based on symbol and zone combinations.

3. *Turn Sequence*:
   - *Casting the Dice*: Players take turns rolling the dice onto the casting cloth/mat.
   - *Interpreting the Symbols*: Players read the symbols based on where they land. For example, a rune symbol landing in the wealth zone could be interpreted as a financial opportunity or challenge.
   - *Scoring Points*: The guidebook provides point values for each symbol-zone combination. Players tally their points after each turn.
   - *Spell Casting*: Some combinations allow players to cast spells, which can be used to add points, subtract points from the opponent, reroll dice, or influence the game in other ways.
   - *Achieving Enlightenment*: Certain high-value combinations or a specific sequence of symbols could represent the path to enlightenment. Achieving this wins the game or ends the round.

4. *Winning the Game*:
   - In multiplayer, the player who first reaches a predetermined point total or who has the most points after a set number of rounds wins.
   - In solo play, the player must achieve enlightenment before time runs out or strive to beat their previous score.

**Development Directions**:
1. *Symbol Design*: Create a unique set of symbols for each die or use existing symbols from tarot, I-Ching, and runes. Ensure each symbol has a clear and distinct meaning.
2. *Guidebook Creation*: Develop a comprehensive guidebook that explains the game rules and the interpretations of the symbols.
3. *Balancing*: Playtest to balance the point system and the effectiveness of spells. The game should offer strategic choices and not rely solely on luck.
4. *Thematic Depth*: Integrate storytelling elements or scenarios that players can immerse themselves in, enhancing the magical and fortune-telling experience.

Remember, the key to a successful game is to create engaging gameplay that combines strategy and chance, along with a rich thematic background that resonates with players. Playtest your game with different groups to get feedback and continue refining it until you achieve the right balance and fun factor."
"Why does gastric pepsin become inactive once the chyme enters the duodenum?
A There is no more protein to digest once the chyme enters the duodenum.
B The enteropeptidases destroy it in the duodenum.
C It requires reactivation and pancreatic enzymes are needed for that.
D It is diluted by pancreatic secretions and is not present in high enough concentrations to be active in duodenum.
E It cannot function at a pH > 3.9",gpt-4-1106-preview,"E It cannot function at a pH > 3.9

Pepsin is an enzyme that works optimally in the acidic environment of the stomach, which has a pH of around 1.5 to 2. When the chyme enters the duodenum, it is mixed with bile from the liver and pancreatic juices, which are alkaline and help to neutralize the acidity of the chyme. The pH in the duodenum is typically around 6 to 7, which is too high for pepsin to function effectively. As a result, pepsin becomes inactive because it cannot operate in this less acidic or neutral environment."
"When a ray of light is reflected off of the surface of another medium, some of the energy from the light is transferred into this medium. As a result, which of the following is true about the reflected light ray?

A It has a higher frequency and a lower wavelength

B It has a higher frequency and a higher wavelength

C It has a lower frequency and a higher wavelength

D It has a lower frequency and a lower wavelength",gpt-4-1106-preview,"When a ray of light is reflected off the surface of another medium, the frequency of the light does not change. The energy transfer into the medium may result in a slight loss of intensity of the reflected light, but the frequency and wavelength of the light remain constant because these are intrinsic properties of the light that are determined by its source.

Both frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) are related to the speed of light (c) by the equation c = fλ. Since the speed of light in a given medium is constant, and because reflection does not change the medium in which the light is traveling, neither frequency nor wavelength will change due to reflection.

Therefore, none of the options (A, B, C, D) are true about the reflected light ray. The correct statement would be:

E It has the same frequency and the same wavelength

Since this option is not provided in your list, the question might be based on a false premise or might be incorrect. Reflection does not change the frequency or wavelength of light."
"I have a labeled cube. Each face is labeled with one of the numbers 1 - 6. I put this cube inside an enclosed box which is just slightly bigger than the cube itself, so that the cube can just fit inside the box. When I put the cube inside the box, I can only see it's top face which displays the number 2. I close the box and shake it for 10 minutes. Which number do I see when I open the box again after shaking it?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"When you shake the cube inside the enclosed box, the cube is likely to tumble and roll around, which means that it can land on any of its six faces when you stop shaking it and open the box. Without a specific pattern or control over how the cube lands, it is impossible to predict with certainty which number will be facing up. The outcome is essentially random, with each face (and therefore each number) having an equal probability of being on top when you open the box.

Therefore, any of the numbers 1 through 6 could be facing up when you open the box, and each has an equal chance of being the top face if we assume a fair cube and a sufficiently random shaking process."

"You are head coach in football manager, world class player when young, intelligent & tactician connoisseur. You are win anything with your own tactics and philosophy. Now, write your tactic, including player roles in every position, provide in possession instruction, in transition instruction & out of possession instruction. present your tactic in front of me how you play & what you want to do with that tactic.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Certainly! As an intelligent tactician and a former world-class player, I've developed a flexible and dominant tactical philosophy that adapts to the strengths of my team while exploiting the weaknesses of the opposition. Here is an overview of my tactical setup:

**Formation:** 4-2-3-1 Deep

The 4-2-3-1 Deep formation provides a solid defensive backbone while allowing for fluid attacking movements. This formation is balanced and can be tweaked to be either more defensive or attacking depending on the situation.

**Player Roles:**

- **Goalkeeper (GK):** Sweeper Keeper (Support) - A proactive goalkeeper who sweeps up through balls and contributes to building play from the back.
- **Right & Left Full-Backs (RB & LB):** Complete Wing-Backs (Support) - Energetic full-backs who bomb forward to provide width and deliver crosses, while also being responsible defensively.
- **Center-Backs (CB):** Ball-Playing Defenders (Defend) - Composed on the ball, able to initiate attacks from deep with their passing ability.
- **Defensive Midfielders (DM):**
  - Deep Lying Playmaker (Defend) - Dictates play from a deeper position, recycling possession and protecting the backline.
  - Ball-Winning Midfielder (Support) - Aggressive in winning back the ball and providing energy in the midfield.
- **Attacking Midfielder Left & Right (AML & AMR):** Inside Forwards (Attack) - Cutting inside with the ball to shoot or create chances, linking up with the striker and central attacking midfielder.
- **Central Attacking Midfielder (CAM):** Advanced Playmaker (Support) - The creative hub of the team, finding pockets of space to operate and linking up play.
- **Striker (ST):** Complete Forward (Support) - A versatile striker who can hold up the ball, bring others into play, and score goals.

**In Possession Instructions:**

- **Build-Up Play:** Play out of defense with short passing and a higher tempo. The focus is on controlled possession and patiently waiting for opportunities.
- **Attacking Width:** Fairly wide to stretch the opposition defense and create space in the middle for the CAM and striker.
- **Approach Play:** Mixed passing, with an emphasis on exploiting the flanks through the complete wing-backs and inside forwards.
- **Final Third:** Look for overlaps from wing-backs and use low crosses to find the striker or late runs from midfield.
- **Creative Freedom:** Be more expressive, allowing creative players to improvise and unlock defenses.

**In Transition Instructions:**

- **When Possession Is Won:** Counter-press to quickly regain possession and exploit any disorganization in the opponent's defense.
- **When Possession Is Lost:** Regroup and maintain a disciplined shape, not allowing easy counter-attacking opportunities.
- **Goalkeeper Distribution:** Distribute to center-backs or the deep-lying playmaker to maintain possession and build from the back.

**Out of Possession Instructions:**

- **Defensive Line & Engagement:** A higher defensive line with a standard line of engagement, compressing the space and forcing opponents into mistakes.
- **Pressing Intensity:** More urgent pressing to win the ball back quickly but not overly aggressive to avoid being easily bypassed.
- **Defensive Width:** Narrow to compact the space centrally and force opponents wide, where the wing-backs can confront them.

**Tactical Philosophy:**

The overarching philosophy is one of control and flexibility. We aim to dominate possession and be patient in our buildup, but we can quickly transition into a direct attacking style if the situation calls for it. Defensively, we are structured and disciplined, looking to regain possession intelligently without being overly exposed to counter-attacks.

The key is to maintain balance and adaptability, ensuring that the team can fluidly switch between a possession-based approach and a more direct, counter-attacking style when the opportunity arises. The players are drilled to be tactically astute, understanding their roles and responsibilities in various phases of play, allowing the team to function as a cohesive and dynamic unit."
"Come up with a male name for a sentient mechanical bull. The bull talks with a heavy southern accent, and uses heavy inflections like ""ya"", ""in'"" instead of ""ing"", ""this here"", and any other typical southern/redneck lingo.

"What else could it say? It was, after all, an omniscient and omnipotent entity, wasn't it?

While it may be erased in the future, for NOW, it did exist in this point in time—such was how the universe worked, PINES.

And a plan quickly took shape in the demon's mind as it saw the two other people present, who it had ignored back then.

Perhaps it should change its target to achieve its grand ambition.怎么改进",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The passage you've written seems like a snippet from a larger narrative involving supernatural elements. To improve clarity and impact, consider the following suggestions:

1. Clarify the nature of the ""it"" being referred to in the first sentence. Is ""it"" the same entity as the demon mentioned later, or something else? This will help the reader understand the subject better.

2. Instead of using ""an omniscient and omnipotent entity,"" which is quite a mouthful and a bit cliché, you could describe the entity's powers more creatively to show rather than tell its capabilities.

3. The phrase ""such was how the universe worked, PINES,"" is a bit unclear. If ""PINES"" is a code or a significant term within your story, it might need a bit more context for the reader to understand its importance.

4. ""And a plan quickly took shape in the demon's mind"" is a bit generic. You could give a hint about the nature of the plan or the demon's thoughts to build intrigue.

5. The phrase ""who it had ignored back then"" could be more specific. When did the demon ignore these people, and why is this relevant now?

6. The sentence structure is somewhat repetitive with multiple ""it was"" and ""it did"" constructs. Varying sentence structure can make the narrative more engaging.

Here's a revised version of your passage:

The entity, both omniscient and omnipotent in its realm, could not be denied its existence at this moment in time—a mere flicker in the vast expanse of the universe, yet here it stood, undeniable and present. The term ""PINES"" resonated with a significance known only to the arcane workings of this realm.

As the demon surveyed its surroundings, previously dismissing the two figures now before it, a devious spark ignited within its dark consciousness. Ignored once, these individuals could no longer be overlooked; they were, after all, pieces on the cosmic chessboard that could be maneuvered to fulfill its grand designs.

With a newfound target and a cunning plan blossoming in its wicked mind, the demon readied itself to weave a new thread into the tapestry of its ambitious scheme.

Remember, the key to improvement is to provide enough detail to paint a clear picture while maintaining the mystery and intrigue that will keep your readers engaged."

"- using matplotlib package and other frameworks that may be useful, Draw the tesla cybertruck. Explain the basic shapes and essence of the car, look for some references of the Cybertruck shape and design, make the output of the very car simple. Write down a plan first, be sure to keep track of where you’re placing shapes location, then output entire clean professional code in code compatible window.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Creating a visual representation of the Tesla Cybertruck using matplotlib will be a simplified process that captures the essence of its design. The Cybertruck is known for its angular, futuristic look, with a distinctive polygonal body. We'll focus on creating a 2D representation using basic shapes such as triangles and rectangles.

Here's a step-by-step plan to draw a simplified version of the Cybertruck:

1. Set up the drawing environment using matplotlib.
2. Create basic shapes that represent the Cybertruck's body, wheels, and windows.
3. Position these shapes correctly to resemble the Cybertruck's profile view.
4. Use lines to add details and emphasize the angular design.
5. Adjust the color and style to match the Cybertruck's metallic finish.
6. Display the final image.

Now, let's create the code to draw the Cybertruck:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches

# Set up the figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the aspect of the plot to be equal
ax.set_aspect('equal')

# Draw the body of the Cybertruck using polygons
body = patches.Polygon([[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [5, 3], [6, 2], [6, 1]], closed=True, facecolor='lightgrey', edgecolor='black')

This code will produce a simple 2D representation of the Tesla Cybertruck. It's important to remember that matplotlib is generally used for plotting and may not be the best tool for creating detailed illustrations. However, it can be used for this purpose with a bit of creativity.

The shapes chosen (rectangles, circles, polygons) are a good starting point to capture the basic form of the Cybertruck. The colors can be adjusted to better match the vehicle's actual appearance. Keep in mind that this is a highly simplified representation, and the actual design of the Cybertruck is more complex."
"1000 events were collected in the muon lifetime measurement.
Distribution can be described by the formula:
dN/dt = N_sig/τ*exp(-t/τ) + dN_bg/dt 0 ≤ t ≤ 15 µs
with flat background level known to be dNbg
dt = 10 ± ∆ µs

Estimate the dependence of the uncertainty on the muon lifetime, στ ,
obtained from the fit on the assumed background uncertainty ∆.
Hint: consider the Hessian matrix of the fit",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To estimate the dependence of the uncertainty on the muon lifetime (σ_τ) on the assumed background uncertainty (Δ), we need to consider the fitting process that is typically used to extract parameters from data.

When you perform a fit to the data with the given distribution, you are typically minimizing a χ² or a negative log-likelihood function. The parameters of the fit in this case are the signal lifetime (τ) and the background level (dN_bg/dt).

The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of the χ² or the negative log-likelihood with respect to the fit parameters. If we denote our fit parameters as θ (a vector containing τ and dN_bg/dt), then the Hessian matrix H can be written as:

H_ij = ∂²χ² / ∂θ_i∂θ_j

where i and j run over the number of parameters.

The covariance matrix C of the fit parameters is the inverse of the Hessian matrix:

C = H⁻¹

The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix give the variances of the fit parameters, and the square root of these variances gives the standard uncertainties (σ) of the parameters:

σ_i = sqrt(C_ii)

Now, the uncertainty on the muon lifetime (σ_τ) is affected by the uncertainty on the background (Δ). When you have an uncertainty on a parameter that is not directly a fit parameter, you need to propagate this uncertainty to the fit parameters using error propagation.

The partial derivative of τ with respect to the background level (dN_bg/dt) will give you how much τ changes when dN_bg/dt changes. The uncertainty on τ due to the uncertainty on the background can be estimated by:

σ_τ(bg) ≈ |∂τ/∂(dN_bg/dt)| * Δ

However, to calculate |∂τ/∂(dN_bg/dt)|, you would need the full fit results, including the correlation between τ and dN_bg/dt from the fit, which is not given here. In a simplified case without the exact values, you could perform the fit multiple times varying the background level within its uncertainty and observe how σ_τ changes. This would give you an empirical relationship between Δ and σ_τ.

If you have access to the actual data and the fit results, you could numerically evaluate the partial derivatives and compute the uncertainty on τ due to the background uncertainty more precisely. If you want to consider the Hessian matrix approach, you would need to calculate the Hessian matrix from the fit, invert it to get the covariance matrix, and then apply error propagation to find how σ_τ depends on Δ.

In practical applications, such as software used for particle physics data analysis (like ROOT), this is often done automatically, and the fit would provide you with an error matrix that already accounts for the correlations between parameters."
"Tengo la siguiente consulta:

public function get_all_by_idinforme($id) {
    $this->db->select('*');
    $this->db->where('id_informe', $id);

    return $result = $query->result_array();
}

pero no obtengo [""recordsTotal""] y [""recordsFiltered""] de datatablejson",gpt-4-1106-preview,"El código que has proporcionado es una función en PHP que utiliza el framework CodeIgniter para realizar una consulta a una base de datos y obtener un conjunto de resultados basado en un `id_informe` específico.

Para poder implementar la funcionalidad de `[""recordsTotal""]` y `[""recordsFiltered""]` que son típicamente usados por el plugin DataTables para mostrar la información sobre el total de registros y los registros filtrados en una tabla, necesitarás modificar tu función para que también calcule estas dos cantidades.

Aquí tienes un ejemplo de cómo podrías modificar tu función para incluir `[""recordsTotal""]` y `[""recordsFiltered""]`:

```php
public function get_all_by_idinforme($id) {
    // Obtener el total de registros sin filtros
    $this->db->from($this->table);
    $recordsTotal = $this->db->count_all_results();

    // Aplicar filtros
    $this->db->select('*');
    $this->db->where('id_informe', $id);

    // Obtener el total de registros con filtros
    $this->db->from($this->table);
    $recordsFiltered = $this->db->count_all_results();

    // Obtener los resultados paginados
    $this->db->order_by('id', 'asc');
    $this->db->limit(100);
    $this->db->offset(0);
    $query = $this->db->get($this->table);
    $result = $query->result_array();

    // Preparar la respuesta para DataTables
    $data = array(
        ""recordsTotal"" => $recordsTotal,
        ""recordsFiltered"" => $recordsFiltered,
        ""data"" => $result
    );

    return $data;
}
```

En este ejemplo, primero se cuenta el total de registros en la tabla sin aplicar ningún filtro para obtener `recordsTotal`. Luego, se aplican los filtros necesarios (en este caso, `where('id_informe', $id)`) y se cuenta nuevamente para obtener `recordsFiltered`. Finalmente, se realiza la consulta paginada para obtener los resultados y se prepara un array con toda la información requerida por DataTables.

Ten en cuenta que dependiendo de cómo estés utilizando los filtros en DataTables, es posible que necesites ajustar la forma en que calculas `recordsFiltered` para que tome en cuenta todos los filtros aplicados por el usuario.

Nota adicional: Hay un error en la línea `$query = $this->db->get($this->$table);` del código original. Debería ser `$query = $this->db->get($this->table);` (sin el signo `$` antes de `table`)."

"We know that Connect 4 is a strongly solved game, meaning the outcome is known to everyone regardless of the board configuration. In this game, two opposing players drop their discs on a seven-column, six-row grid to be the first to align them vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If one side can force a win, who will it be and how? Also, in what year was it solved by which people?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Connect 4 is indeed a solved game. The first player (the one who drops a disc first) can always win by playing the right moves. The key to winning is to play in the center column first. This gives the first player the most opportunities to build connections in all directions (vertically, horizontally, and diagonally) and limits the second player's chances to block them. The strategy involves a combination of offensive moves to build toward a Connect Four and defensive moves to prevent the opponent from doing the same.

Connect 4 was solved by James D. Allen on October 1, 1988, and independently by Victor Allis on October 16, 1988. Victor Allis also detailed a winning strategy for the first player in his master's thesis, which included the knowledge base of how to win from any given position.

Both researchers used a computational approach to demonstrate that with perfect play, the first player can force a win by starting in the center column and then playing the perfect sequence of moves thereafter, regardless of the responses by the second player. This strongly solved status means that the outcome can be correctly predicted from any position, assuming both players play optimally."

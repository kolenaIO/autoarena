Abstract
Cricket, the second most popular sport in the world, has emerged as one of the most widely played international mainstream sports
in the world. With the advent of newer formats such as the Twenty-twenty (T-20) over cricket, the popularity of the game has
further soared, spurting out international leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL), over
the last one decade. Over the course of more than 450 years since the inception of this sports in south-east England, statistics have
played a pivotal role in shaping the structure and format of the game. Of late, there have been considerable advancements in cricket
data analytics using IoT-based cricket bat sensors, advanced video analysis using Pitch-Vision, Hawk-Eye and allied technologies.
From providing trajectories of the ball, to measuring the speed and impact point of the ball hitting the bat, such stellar breakthroughs
have made it possible to fathom and analyze the game in a more refined way. Internet of Things (IoT) and Data Analytics can be
the proponents in learning more about the stroke play of players as well as about the myriad facets of the game. In this paper, we
have endeavored to discover a novel paradigm of research in cricket analytics known as the timing index, based on a real life IoT-
based implementation and case study. The timing index is based on an amalgam of different factors such as bat speed, back lift
angle, max. bat speed and impact bat speed. We believe that such a study can help in analyzing a player’s training sessions using
IoT and data analytics, thereby accurately and holistically analyzing a player’s game and going beyond traditional statistical
reporting, by ushering in intriguing and insightful information.

1. Introduction
The genesis of cricket lies in South East England, dating back to the 16 th century, in Surrey, which has references
to this ‘bat and ball’ game. Citing Wikipedia and other references in the upcoming paras, we would first like to
introduce the game of cricket in brief. Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each
on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, ""bowls"" (propels)
the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an ""over"" being completed once they have
legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end
of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs either when the ball
reaches the boundary of the field, or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding
side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out"", and are said to have ""lost their wicket"").
Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the
fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can
cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends
and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in
international matches. The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread
globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th
century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve
of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, the United
Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a
single innings of 20 overs and the game generally lasting three hours, One Day Cricket comprising of 50 overs to Test
matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear
club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the
ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork
core layered with a tight string. [1] Thus, cricket is a highly tactical game in its truest sense and hence has a tremendous
scope for applying an analytical viewpoint, especially pertaining to the use of modern technology and data analytics.
2. Related work
Right since the 2000s, the game of cricket has witnessed a significant paradigm shift with the advent of technologies
such as the snick-o-meter, hawk-eye etc. There has also been a considerable amount of work on decision making
approaches to cricket team selection, predicting the outcome of matches, ranking and rating players on their match-
day performance and so on. [2][3][4][5] There has also been some pioneering work on using simulators for simulating
cricket matches across different teams and venues, using principal component analysis for prediction, using
programming approaches for fantasy league prediction and so on. [6][7][8][9] Statistical approaches such as generating
content-based recommendations, personalized recommendations, factor analysis and integer optimization have also
yielded some productive results when it comes to the scoring, ranking and prediction of cricket players and matches.
[10][11][12][13][14] Batting order is a very important and dynamic part of cricket wherein it is essential to have
batsmen playing a certain role viz. anchor, pinch hitter, finisher etc. Top, middle and lower are three parts of the batting
order which have designated roles to fulfill so as to win the game, be it while chasing or while batting first. Research
has been done on the aforementioned aspects as well, in deciding batting orders based on a plethora of analytical
factors. [15][16][17] In the recent past, advances have been made in implementing IoT technologies for gathering vital
cricket bat data such as the STR8T, Stance-beam and Bat-sense cricket bat IoT sensors.[18][19] They collect various
data points pertaining to the swing of the bat and help the batsmen understand the game better. [20][21][22][23] Cricket
analytics has also grown as a field, wherein the data from various matches and tournaments can be analyzed using
Python and other languages for churning out important insights related to player performance.[24] While there has
been a huge growth in which the game of cricket is played, perceived, analyzed and interpreted, it is still a very nascent
field. AI and Machine Learning can especially be used to analyze statistical data in cricket. Combining it with the
aforementioned IoT sensors, we believe that a significant revolution can be ushered in the era of cricket analytics.

3. Data Analytics in the Game of Cricket using IoT: A real-life implementation and case study
Cricket bat sensors have revolutionized the way in which cricket data is analyzed and interpreted. The cricket bat
sensor is either applied at the top or back of the bat and using the various embedded sensors, it captures the movement
of the bat as well as the player during the shot. For the context of this study, we used the aforementioned Stance Beam ©
cricket bat sensor. Stance Beam is a cricket bat sensor in which a sensor of the size of about 5 cms is attached at the
top of the bat. After calculating pitch orientation, make and model of the bat as well as its weight, the sensor is
calibrated in a way that it helps to analyze the batter’s shots in real time. For the context of this paper, we tried to
simulate real-life playing conditions of having a pitch of exact 22 yards in length and approximately 3 meters in width.
The bowling was a mixture of conventional pace bowling and deliveries bowled through a robo-arm, with an average
speed of around 120 kmph. The cricket batting net session lasted 15 mins. for the primary author and had 5 overs or
30 balls delivered, out of which the first 6 were used to test and calibrate the sensor. Thereafter we were able to collate
and interpret vital data for 24 deliveries, which is equivalent to a conventional net session in cricket clubs. To make
the study as real as possible, there were no premeditated shots and everything was impromptu, as is in real cricket
matches. To ascertain the effectiveness of the batting session and various batting parameters that were analyzed, it is
essential to understand which parameters were taken into account and how were they calculated. As summarized in
table 1, the key metrices involved whether the batter moved forwards (front foot) or backwards (back foot), which is
a vital evaluation of a batter’s stroke play in cricket, known as ‘footwork’. The next metric involves the different types
of shots that were played along with their names. Thereafter, the most important three factors involving the back swing
are enunciated which includes the back lift angle, which is the max. horizontal angle achieved during the back lift
motion before the start of the downswing. The downswing angle is the angle between the start of the downswing to
the point where bat makes an impact with the ball. Lastly, the follow through angle is the motion of the bat after hitting
the ball, and is the angle if the bat from the point of impact with the ball to the end of the bat swing. Bat face direction
is the point of the bat’s face calculated before the start of the swing from the center of the stumps and back lift direction
angle is the angle calculated from the center of the stumps up to the stance point before the ball. Lastly, the max speed
of the bat swing is taken into account and corroborated with the bat speed at the point of impact of the ball. Since all
these quantities are measured in a plethora of units, it is scientifically inadvisable to do any arithmetic operations for
calculating the timing index. Hence, we have labelled the timing index on the basis of a holistic overview of these
factors and categorized it into 5 categories viz. Early - E, Late - L, Missed - M, Timed - T and Well-Left - W.

The paper specifically mentions the use of IoT (Internet of Things) cricket bat sensors and how these devices can collect data that can be used to analyze a player's performance. The authors propose a novel metric called the ""timing index,"" which seems to be based on an amalgamation of factors such as bat speed, back lift angle, max bat speed, and impact bat speed. The timing index helps in analyzing the quality of a player's shot timing.

This research appears to be contributing to the growing field of sports analytics, where technology and data are used to improve player performance and strategic decision-making. In cricket, as well as in other sports, this type of analytical approach can be invaluable for coaches and players to refine techniques, develop game strategies, and improve overall team performance.

The study outlined in the excerpt seems to have included real-life implementations and case studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed timing index. The sensor technology mentioned, such as the Stance Beam© cricket bat sensor, provides detailed metrics that allow for an in-depth analysis of a player's batting session. This can provide actionable insights that can be used during training to enhance a player's skills.

"Summarize this article:

Amabel Holland, a forty-one-year-old board-game designer from Dearborn, Michigan, believes that a chance discovery at a comic-book store saved her life. In 2010, she wandered into the shop with her wife and a friend, looking for issues of the Marvel series “The New Mutants.” In the basement, she noticed a board game called The Settlers of Catan. It was a 3-D edition, costing more than two hundred dollars. Amabel didn’t particularly want to play the game, but she was surprised by its fanciness. She browsed the store some more and noticed that many games’ boxes prominently displayed the names of their designers, as if they were authors. This wasn’t the familiar childhood terrain of Monopoly, Candy Land, and Sorry! These games were often dauntingly complex, and engaged with topics like history, politics, and the building of industries and empires.

After visiting the store, Amabel and her wife, Mary Holland, played a few board games, and eventually Amabel tried designing one. She’d spent years creating music, comics, and films without attracting much of an audience, and had felt some despair about her artistic work. But Amabel, who is autistic, thinks about the world in terms of systems, and she suspected that in games she might find her voice. You could make a board game about almost anything, and, when you did, its rules could both mirror and analyze the subject on which it was based.

Over the next few years, Amabel designed and published about thirty games through various companies. Then, in 2016, she and Mary created their own publisher, Hollandspiele. It’s since published more than seventy games, roughly half designed by Amabel; she is widely considered one of today’s most innovative game designers. Her work, which is part of a larger turn toward complexity in the industry, often tackles historical and social subjects—death, religion, misinformation—using surprising “mechanics,” or building blocks of game play, to immerse players in an experience. “I’m interested in games’ ability to engage with difficult topics,” she told me. “And I’m interested in the way that mechanics can be used to do that.”

Mechanics can be appealingly simple, as they are in checkers. But games with richer mechanics can offer richer experiences. In Monopoly, which was published in 1935, you can roll dice to move, auction assets, build properties on tiles, and draw special-power cards (“Get Out of Jail Free”). Things escalate from there. “There’s definitely been a lot of innovation in the last twenty years,” Amabel said. A recent encyclopedia of mechanics in tabletop games—a category that includes board games, card games (such as Magic: The Gathering), and party games (such as Codenames)—defines close to two hundred.

“With every game, you build a certain model of the world,” Reiner Knizia, a former mathematician who’s designed more than eight hundred games, told me. Several of his games illustrate market forces: in Modern Art, for instance, you play as auctioneers and buyers, hoping to buy low and sell high. Knizia is a traditional game designer inasmuch as he aims to “bring enjoyment to the people.” But Amabel sometimes aims for the opposite of enjoyment. Her game This Guilty Land, from 2018, is about the struggle to end slavery; The Vote, from 2020, is about women’s suffrage. “They’re meant to evoke frustration,” she said—to demonstrate the difficulty of political progress—“which is not usually what people are looking for in games.”

Lately, Amabel has been trying to combine the heavy with the light. One of her newest games, Kaiju Table Battles, uses carefully calibrated mechanics to tackle the highly personal topic of gender transition in a way that is both uplifting and widely appealing. (Until 2021, she published under the name Tom Russell.) Through colorful, Godzilla-like creatures, it tells the story of how Amabel became Amabel.

The world of board games began to transform in the nineteen-nineties. Catan, which was first published in Germany, in 1995, helped popularize “Euro-style” games over “Ameritrash” titles that often depended on randomness, direct conflict, and dramatic shifts of fortune. (Back to square one!) Eurogames tended to reward planning, and allowed players to interact indirectly—by acquiring coveted building materials, for instance. Since then, the industry has seen a steady increase in complex games. In 2021, researchers analyzed the ten thousand games with the highest rankings on the Web site BoardGameGeek, and found that, between 2000 and 2020, the average number of mechanics in new games had increased from roughly two and a half to four. The 2017 game Gloomhaven, which held the highest rating on the site for years, utilizes nineteen mechanics.

“Designers are becoming more focussed on the experience the players are having, and are using a stronger tool kit to build better games,” Geoff Engelstein, who teaches board-game design at New York University and co-authored the encyclopedia of game mechanics, told me. In older games, he said, such as Risk and Monopoly, the goal was, frequently, to tear everyone else down, but in newer games this is often impossible; in the train game Ticket to Ride, for example, you can’t destroy other players’ tracks. It’s also become less common to lose a turn, which makes players less engaged, and games are increasingly designed to prevent blowouts by winners. Rob Daviau, the co-designer of Pandemic Legacy, the current No. 2 game on BoardGameGeek, is a co-owner of Restoration Games, a company that republishes older games while updating their mechanics. One common shift, he said, is from post-decision luck to pre-decision luck. Instead of striking a monster and then rolling the dice to see if you’ve caused damage, you roll the dice first, then have to get creative about how to use what you’ve rolled.

A few games have introduced entirely new mechanics. Dominion, from 2008, popularized deck-building, in which players curate a collection of cards that grant points or powers. (The same mechanic is used in Magic: The Gathering.) Risk Legacy, another game co-designed by Daviau, inaugurated legacy games, in which “game states”—changes to the board, characters, or rules—carry over from session to session. (Daviau, who once worked for Hasbro, came up with the concept while talking about Clue at a brainstorming session. “I don’t know why these people keep coming over to dinner!” he said.)

Amabel’s game Kaiju Table Battles uses a legacy system: in the course of multiple sessions, players unseal envelopes containing new content. While working on it, she watched most of the Godzilla and Gamera movies; she also created her own monsters, commissioned art, and built a prototype. When I visited her, she was in the mechanics phase—“the nitty gritty of figuring out, What exactly does this monster do?” she explained. In the movies, monsters like Godzilla represent big, intangible fears, such as the atomic bomb. But Amabel identified more with the strange beasts than with the people trying to kill them; she wanted to make a game in which the monsters developed and grew. One of her characters, a plant monster, would obey unique mechanics: it would be fragile and push other monsters away. “So it’s very lonely and isolated,” Amabel said. “But then it will evolve and go from being this kind of weird, viny, weedy plant to a flowering plant and come into its power. It’s going to be stronger, and actually help other monsters work better, and have more sense of community, because it’s actually acting as itself.”

Amabel describes herself as a “shitposter”—someone who is wrong on purpose in a funny, adversarial way that can still get at the truth. On social media, where she writes about game design and her dating life—she and Mary separated, in 2021—she explains that, although many of her games are historical, they are not “ ‘balanced’ works of history” but “political art” and “queer rage & shitposting all the way down.” Recently, she has published games about Dracula, the tobacco industry (her father died of lung cancer), and the Shackleton expedition. The latter game, called Endurance, has no “victory condition”; your only hope is to limit your losses as crew members die. In reality, all of Ernest Shackleton’s men survived their failed attempt to reach the South Pole—but the game models the circumstances, not the outcome, and expresses deeper ideas about adversity. On a podcast hosted by the game reviewer Daniel Thurot, Amabel explained that she could not have made Endurance before her gender transition. “It was kind of living through my own misery and my own miracle that made me think about the odds,” she said. “Because the odds of me figuring out my shit were, like, so long.” She found time to think about her gender only because she’d left an office job to work on games full time; she undertook her transition with the help of a trans woman, Erin Escobedo, who’d created a game published by Hollandspiele; Escobedo, in turn, had learned about the company only because it had previously published a title by a big-time designer named Cole Wehrle, who knew Amabel because of Amabel’s first game, Northern Pacific. “If all those things didn’t happen, I don’t know if I would be here today talking to you,” she told Thurot. Endurance is a game in which anything can, and usually does, go wrong.

The recent explosion in the popularity of board games—the industry’s annual revenue is expected to increase from around a billion dollars in 2017 to nearly five billion in 2026—has vastly expanded the number and variety of games that can be published. Crowdfunding, online communities, and on-demand printing have also contributed. Independent designers can now find dedicated audiences. The Zenobia Award celebrates designers from marginalized groups who are creating historical games; recent winning games have centered on subjects including caste in India under colonialism, the functions of Machu Picchu, and an economic system used by Cherokee people in the sixteenth century. In 2019, Elizabeth Hargrave released Wingspan, a beautifully illustrated Euro-style game about birds; nearly two million copies are in print. Historically, she told me, most players and designers and publishers of games have been men; the industry is slowly escaping their grip. “Not everybody enjoys killing monsters in dungeons,” said Isaac Childres, the designer of Gloomhaven, which is about killing monsters in dungeons.

John du Bois, a game designer whom Hollandspiele has published, met me and Amabel at the apartment of Amabel’s girlfriend, Samhain Bones. (Bones, who named herself Samhain after the Halloween-adjacent pagan holiday when she transitioned a few years ago, had on a pink tank top that said “BE GAY DO CRIME!” and skeletal wrist warmers.) This gave us a foursome for sampling some modern games. We started with Amabel’s Northern Pacific. The board shows a network of potential paths connecting cities. Players must build train tracks connecting Minneapolis to Seattle; on each turn, they can either place a cube on a city and hope that a train comes there, or place a train on a track segment. One tactic is to see where an opponent might direct her trains and place your own cubes to reap the rewards. “It’s about leaving your opponents with the most bad choices,” du Bois said.

Next was Turncoats, from another publisher, Milda Matilda Games. A map contains eleven adjacent regions and a smattering of stones in three colors. Each player receives eight stones to hide in her hand; she can either place them on the map or take actions to alter their distribution in her hand or on the map. At the end of the game, the player who holds in her hand the color that has dominated the most regions on the map is the winner. The trick is to guide the board toward a certain color without depleting that color f",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Amabel Holland, an autistic board-game designer from Michigan, discovered her passion for board games after an unexpected visit to a comic-book store. Initially an artist in various media, she found that designing games allowed her to express complex systems and engage with serious topics. Hollandspiele, her publishing company with her wife Mary, has released over seventy games, many designed by her. Amabel's approach to game design often involves incorporating heavy themes like slavery and women's suffrage, aiming to provoke thought and frustration rather than just entertainment.

The board game industry has evolved significantly since the 1990s, with a shift toward more complex, planning-oriented ""Euro-style"" games rather than luck-based ""Ameritrash"" games. There has been a rise in the variety of mechanics used in games, enhancing the player experience. Modern games tend to be more inclusive, focusing on preventing winner blowouts and engaging all players throughout gameplay.

Amabel's recent work includes a game about gender transition, which uses a legacy system where changes carry over between play sessions. Her personal experiences, including her gender transition and her father's death from lung cancer, have influenced her game designs. As an advocate for political art and queer expression, she utilizes her platform to discuss game design and personal topics.

The board game industry is growing, with a projected increase in annual revenue and a burgeoning number of independent designers due to crowdfunding, online communities, and on-demand printing. This has led to a more diverse range of game topics and designers, including those from marginalized groups.

Hollandspiele has published a variety of games, including some that challenge traditional victory conditions, reflecting a broader trend in the industry towards innovation and inclusivity in game design."

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers
HIPAA compliance for call centers that operate as business associates for covered entities consists of complying with the Security and Breach Notification Rule and the sections of the Privacy Rule relating to permissible uses and disclosures and the minimum necessary standard.

HIPAA compliance for call centers is an essential consideration for every company providing an answering service or call-forwarding service for the healthcare industry. Since the Final Omnibus Rule updated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 2013, all service providers processing, storing, or transmitting ePHI directly or on behalf of a healthcare organization are directly liable for data breaches attributable to non-compliance with the Privacy and Security Rules.

What this means in practice is that healthcare organizations will avoid engaging the services of a call center unless the call center is communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA. HIPAA compliant texting in call centers is not difficult or expensive to implement. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that HIPAA compliance for call centers accelerates the cycle of communication – streamlining workflows and enhancing the level of service provided to patients.

Healthcare Organizations Implement Secure Texting Solutions
Some of the most relevant areas of HIPAA relating to HIPAA compliance for call centers are within the HIPAA Security Rule. The Security Rule includes standards such as who should have access to ePHI, how the integrity of ePHI should be maintained while patient data is being transmitted, and what controls should be put in place to prevent an accidental or malicious breach of ePHI.


Many healthcare organizations have implemented secure texting solutions to comply with the requirements of the Security Rule, and these solutions are equally appropriate to ensure HIPAA compliant messaging in call centers as an alternative to insecure forms of communication such as SMS, Instant Messaging and email. When email is used, a secured method of email archiving is required.

By implementing their own secure texting solutions, call centers will be communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA with the necessary safeguards in place to control who has access to ePHI, ensure the end-to-end integrity of ePHI and to prevent any breaches of ePHI – either accidental or malicious.

How HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers Works
Secure texting solutions ensure HIPAA compliance for call centers by only allowing authorized users to access the call center´s private communications network. Access to the network is gained via secure messaging apps only with an admin-issued username and PIN code.

Once into the network, authorized users can then communicate with other authorized users, share documents, files and images as attachments, and engage in secure group discussions when a scenario arises that would benefit from collaboration.

Safeguards are in place to prevent ePHI being transmitted outside of the call center´s network, copied and pasted or saved to an external hard drive. All activity on the network is monitored by a cloud-based secure messaging network and, if a potential breach of ePHI is discovered, any communication can be remotely retracted and deleted.

All communications are encrypted to NIST standards so that they are unreadable, undecipherable and unusable in the event that they are intercepted on a public Wi-Fi network; and – should an authorized user lose their mobile device or have it stolen – administrators can PIN lock the device to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI.

Other safeguards to ensure HIPAA compliance for call centers includes “message lifespans” – a feature that removes messages containing ePHI from an authorized user´s computer or mobile device after a pre-determined period of time – and “app time outs”, a safety feature that logs users out of the network after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI when a desktop computer or mobile device is left unattended.

The Advantages of Communicating ePHI in Compliance with HIPAA
There are multiple advantages of HIPAA compliance for call centers – not just for the call center communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA, but also for the healthcare organization it is providing a service for:

HIPAA compliant texting in call centers enables on-call physicians to receive sensitive patient information on the go.
Wound images, x-rays and patient histories can also be attached to secure text messages to save the physician´s time on arrival.
Delivery notifications and read receipts eliminate the need for follow-up messages and reduce the amount of time lost playing phone tag.
Both the call center and the healthcare organization it provides a service for can implement BYOD policies without the risk of an ePHI breach.
Physicians and other medical professionals can leverage the speed and convenience of mobile technology to provide a higher level of service to patients.
Communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA also increases message accountability, as the following case study demonstrates.
With seventeen locations in the Tucson area of Arizona, the call center serving the El Rio Community Health Centers implemented a HIPAA-compliant texting solution to address issues it was having with efficient call support, patient follow-up and message accountability.

As a result of HIPAA compliant texting in call centers, response times improved so that 95 percent of concerns were answered in sixty seconds or less, the concerns were evaluated and resolved more efficiently to provide a higher level of service to patients, and message accountability increased by 22 percent.

By being able to monitor communication metrics, administrators at the Community Health Centers were able to create a streamlined workflow that ensured proper patient follow-up and risk management. According to the organization´s CIO, communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA eliminated lost message errors which translated into increased patient satisfaction.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers – Conclusion
We mentioned at the beginning of this article that healthcare organizations will avoid engaging the services of a call center unless it can be independently verified the call center is communicating ePHI in compliance with HIPAA. However, that should not be the sole reason for HIPAA compliance for call centers.

HIPAA compliant texting in call centers can lead to the healthcare organizations served by the call center streamlining workflows and enhancing the level of service provided to patients. If a healthcare organization benefits from the service it receives from the call center, the call centers reputation will be enhanced and new opportunities may arise.

We also mentioned at the beginning of this article that HIPAA compliant texting in call centers is not difficult or expensive to implement. This is because the secure messaging apps have a text-like interface that authorized users will already be familiar with and that will require no special training before they can use.

As HIPAA compliance for call centers is provided via a cloud-based “Software-as-a-Service” platform, there is no need to invest in new servers, additional hardware or complicated software programs. Secure texting solutions come “out of the box” and can be implemented with twenty-four hours to fulfill all of a call center´s secure texting requirements.

HIPAA Compliance for Call Centers: FAQs
Don´t business associates such as call centers only have to comply with the Security Rule?
This is not true. All business associates have to comply with the Security Rule, the Breach Notification Rule, and any applicable standards in the Privacy Rule. In the context of HIPAA compliance for call centers, this would include the General principles for Uses and Disclosures of PHI, employee training on Privacy Rule policies, and adhering to the Minimum Necessary Standard.

What happens if a call center does not comply with all applicable HIPAA standards?
If a call center does not comply with all applicable HIPAA standards, it must not be used as a business associate by a healthcare organization, and any existing contracts must be terminated. If a data breach occurs due to a call center failing to comply with any area of HIPAA, both the call center and healthcare organization could face civil penalties from HHS´ Office for Civil Rights.

What are the civil penalties for data breaches?
The civil penalties for impermissible disclosures of ePHI depend on the nature of the disclosure, how many records were disclosed, what efforts were made to prevent the disclosure, and how quickly the cause of the impermissible disclosure(s) was rectified. HHS´ Office for Civil Rights can impose non-financial civil penalties such as Corrective Action Orders for minor violations of HIPAA, and/or a financial penalty depending on the negligent party´s degree of culpability. The current financial penalties are:

Penalty Tier	Level of Culpability	Minimum Penalty per Violation	Maximum Penalty per Violation	Annual Penalty Limit
Tier 1	Reasonable Efforts	$127	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 2	Lack of Oversight	$1,280	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 3	Neglect – Rectified within 30 days	$12,794	$63,973	$1,919,173
Tier 4	Neglect – Not Rectified within 30 days	$63,973	$1,919,173	$1,919,173
How might HHS´ Office for Civil Rights find out about a data breach?
Under the Breach Notification Rule, covered entities and business associates are required to report all breaches to HHS´ Office for Civil Rights unless there is a low probability that ePHI exposed in the impermissible disclosure has been compromised. If a reportable breach occurs, and a Covered Entity or Business Associate neglects to comply with the Breach Notification Rule, this will be reflected in the amount of civil penalty imposed once HHS´ Office for Civil Rights finds out about the breach.

How might HHS´ Office for Civil Rights find out about an unreported data breach?
HHS´ Office for Civil Rights not only investigates reports made by covered entities and business associates, but also complaints made by individuals. Consequently, HHS´ Office for Civil Rights might find out about an unreported data breach if a member of the public makes a complaint following (for example) unusual activity in their bank account, unsolicited phone calls or emails, or an increase in their health insurance premiums (due to fraudulent use of healthcare).

"summerize this in 10 bullet points :
women are interested in you and they
want you to go and talk to them and make
sure you watch until the end because the
third thing I'm going to teach you is
arguably the most important piece of
information if you want to get a
girlfriend in the next couple months now
I know that it's very tough to navigate
dating when you are a young man I know
that it's been very difficult for me as
soon as I was able to be successful with
women it was like the clouds parted and
the sun came out it literally made me
more conf I know that sounds kind of
weird and most guys don't want to admit
it but when you are successful going and
talking to girls it just makes you feel
so much better about yourself because
nobody wants to be lonely
H as humans we love being around other
humans especially girls they're very fun
to be around and they're hot I wasn't
very successful with girls and I felt
like they weren't interested in me now
I'm sure that you've been in a position
before where you want to go and talk to
a girl but you're just un able to do it
you would love to have a girlfriend
you'd love to be better at talking to
girls and it would just boost your
confidence overall and maybe even get
you into a relationship now on the
screen here I've put multiple video
clips of me going up and talking to
girls in real life and the reason I'm
doing this is because one I know that
you have a short attention span but two
I want to show you that it's actually
possible how many times have you clicked
on a video like this and it's just some
guy in a room and you have no idea if he
actually knows what he's talking about
men are visual Learners we don't believe
something unless we can actually see it
with our own two eyes so after I
graduated high school I was going
through a little bit of a dry spell I
was working full-time as a construction
worker and most of my buddies we would
just drink on weekends we never went out
and I didn't want to be that guy that
was like Hey guys let's go meet some
girls because my friends just seemed
very judgmental over that maybe your
friends are the same way comment below
are your friends kind of like y dude
that's weird but what I ended up doing
was I started walking around downtown in
my city and I was so nervous about going
to talk to girls I would only start
conversations with old ladies like I
know it sounds kind of embarrassing but
you know what it's like you're at the
grocery store and there's like an old
lady and she needs help with her
groceries and you're like hey ma'am can
I help you load them into your car you
know you open the door and you push the
card out and she's like oh you're so
sweet you know I always do that it's
just like a man thing I started to do
that over and over again and I noticed
that older women treated me so well
maybe it was because they were deeply
attracted to me and they wanted me to
come over and clean their EAS drops you
know what I
mean realistically older women are so
easy to talk to and they're just very
nurturing and caring they make you feel
normal and loved and after talking to
them a couple of times it got me
confident enough that women don't hate
me and I can actually go and talk to
them and have a normal conversation and
this was very helpful because I just
assumed that they were all super nice
and loving and caring the same way old
lady are I know it sounds silly but just
try it bro trust me the first thing that
most guys completely forget about is a
woman's perspective when you think about
it women are actually very similar to
men we both want the same things sure
the qualities are a little bit different
like the exact details might be a bit
different but that's because men and
women are different as men what we want
to do is feel loved and important but
respected at the same time as the leader
as the person that goes out and performs
whereas women they want to be loved and
appreciated as a feminine role not a
masculine role they want to feel
feminine so when you look at things from
their point of view you understand how
to communicate with them better for
example as a man it is your job to
perform which means we have to be the
ones to go and approach women in real
life we have to start the conversation
and we have to risk getting rejected I
know it sounds scary bro trust me I've
been rejected so many times change
numbers no I'm all right thank you my
dog would love you though I know oh
cringe right but guess what I lived to
tell the tale whoa I didn't die and
evaporate into the universe don't worry
bro rejection is not actually that bad
but what you learn is that the risk that
it takes to go and potentially humiliate
yourself and get rejected is what women
are attracted to because this shows that
you're a leader you are willing to take
chances and when you're willing to take
chances that makes you courageous and
masculine so from their point of view
when they're sitting there on a bench
literally waiting for you to come and
talk to them they think that it is
confident and courageous that you go and
start a conversation with them because
they would never do that women very
rarely go and talk to guys in real life
it's a very masculine thing to do to go
and talk to a stranger you don't know
obviously they're not going to just
decide to be masculine all the sudden
they're going to want to be feminine and
they want want to feel feminine which is
why they sit and they wait they are
waiting for you to go and talk to them
now obviously in the clips that I've
showed you before as well as the ones
that are popping up on the screen right
now one of the best times to approach
women in real life is when they are
sitting down because when you're walking
by a girl on a busy street you could be
in a hurry somewhere she could be in a
hurry I think that you should still
approach people in this situation but
it's just much more rushed and it's not
as accessible whereas when somebody
isitt sitting on a bench or a picnic
table or at a cafe or restaurant they
are usually not busy doing anything like
maybe she's on the phone with a family
member maybe she's reading a book but
realistically she could do that
somewhere privately like at her house or
inside or with headphones in or whatever
but if you're sitting outside just
enjoying the weather chilling you are
usually very open to people coming and
starting a conversation with you that's
why you're in public this used to happen
to me all the time I thought that I was
bothering or to disturbing people when I
went and talked to them especially women
but then I did it a bunch of times and I
got really good results as you can see
here and now I'm like wait a second
they're literally sitting out there
waiting for a confident guy to come up
and talk to them this is the cheat code
and if you're like me and you learn best
by watching videos of me actually doing
this then you need to click the link in
the description below check out
socializer it's a program I made where I
have dozens of videos like this where I
go and I talk to strangers and I break
it down step by step and show you
exactly how to be confident be
charismatic approach and start an
interaction get a girls phone number go
on dates and get a girlfriend in 60 to
90 days and you could check out some of
the testimonials on my website if you
don't believe me I know it sounds like
too good to be true but I've gotten some
amazing results man my program works
very well now the next thing I need you
to realize is that she wants you to
solve her problems for her now I want
you to think really quickly about your
own situation what are your problems
that you want solved why do men get into
relationships well obviously we have
very high testosterone we are horny all
the time and we want an attractive girl
but what about other stuff like you want
a girl that you can hang out with
multiple times per week you don't want
to have to constantly go and meet new
girls go on a first date and it doesn't
really go anywhere you're not really
feeling a connection you don't want to
deal with girls that are just toxic and
they're annoying and they're a headache
and you also don't want to spend time on
all these dating apps that are just
destroying your mental health so the
solution for you would be find an
attractive woman that you can
consistently hang out with and have a
fun time with and then make her your
girlfriend that feminine energy at the
end of the day when you get off work and
you want somebody to make you a little
coffee come up give you a massage give
you a fresh pair of clothing to put on I
mean dude this is priceless I mean what
guy doesn't want that I don't care what
you read in the comment section every
dude would like to have a chick take
care of him a little bit okay and let's
say that there's a cool concert you want
to go to but all your friends are busy
it's like well you know what why don't I
just bring this chick with me then we'll
get a bite to eat go out for some drinks
walk around explore it's just fun to
have this experience with a girl with
her feminine energy because she brings
your masculine energy out of you you
might be stressed out and it's probably
because your masculine energy is just
clashing with everything else in the
world like I know that when I wasn't
around women I had so much masculine
energy that I was just constantly in a
state of being aggressive and stressed
out and just competitive and it was very
good for me because it made me money and
it helped me get better at all this
stuff but it's one of those things where
like you need to have balance in your
life now that you understand this though
I want you to think about her point of
view what are the problems that she has
obviously the first one is that a lot of
women they feel unloved they want love
and attention from men but they don't
want too much and they also want to kind
of earn that attention because when you
get attention easily it's not that
valuable this is where a lot of guys go
wrong they just give a bunch of
attention to a girl thinking that
that'll make the girl like them but what
ends up happening is they give too much
attention and the girl didn't earn it so
the girl is no longer interested in you
so what she wants is a little bit of
attention sometimes and she wants you to
challenge her so that she actually has
to earn it by doing things that you
enjoy by being that feminine girl that
you are looking for she also obviously
wants to feel safe protected she wants
to go and do stuff and she wants you to
be the leader and take her places so the
same way the girls are waiting for you
to go and talk to them they're also
waiting for you to set stuff up they
want somebody to set up the dates they
want somebody to make decisions for them
they want somebody to be the leader most
girls just want a guy to drive the car
so that they could sit in the passenger
seat and talk I swear to God man that's
all girls want when you think about it
from their point of view it makes total
sense you need to solve their problems
for them and when it comes to dating if
they can consistently see the same guy
be challenged by him take care of him
nurture him and be in Intimate
situations with him then that solves all
their problems and it makes their life
better too I swear so many of you are
very selfish you think that everything
is about you but you got to look from
the woman's point of view what problems
does she have in her life and how can
you solve them
indirectly by being the masculine man
that she wants these are the things I
teach my guys in social life school and
it just makes such a difference when
they understand what they've been
oblivious to their entire dating life up
until they get into the program now the
next thing that I need to share with you
and this is what I said before was super
important and valuable and most guys
ignore this is that you cannot wait too
long to get good at this I was having a
conversation the other day with a c",gpt-4-1106-preview,"1. Women are interested in you and await your approach; watching until the end reveals crucial information for getting a girlfriend soon.

    Fiddle tune, Waltzing Thru The Leaves (under)

A fiddle brought by Pierre Bruce to the Selkirk settlement around 1815 served multiple generations with music and meaning that evolved with the family’s expanding connections and Metis identity.
In the nineteenth century the violin, or fiddle, was particularly suited to the conditions of the fur trade.  It was small and light enough for long distance travel and had longevity with its four replaceable strings and loud enough to project tunes to an entire room of dancers.  It was frequently accompanied by the clapping of hands, stomping of feet or percussion from a drum, or pan or spoons.

The Metis are one of three distinct Aboriginal peoples of Canada recognized under the 1982 Canadian Constitution.  During the Fur Trade of 1670-1870 the Metis were known to be fiercely independent and instrumental in the development.  The word Metis was used initially to describe the children of Native women and French men, Over time, the word Metis became the accepted term attributed to all children born to Native women and European men.

                        Metis Fiddler on camera from his home studio.

When I was a young boy first picking up the fiddle, I listened to many different fiddlers play tunes like Red River Jig, Drops of Brandy, Whiskey Before Breakfast and others.  The players that grabbed my attention and touched my heart were people like Homer Poitras and Gerry Lepine simply because of the feeling they put into the Metis music.  By taking a bit of what I heard from each of these different players, I began to develop my own style when playing theses old tunes.

I began playing fiddle at four years old according to the Suzuki Method. I was pretty good by the time I was sixteen and I started teaching taking over from my teacher when he retired.  Being kind of a natural player and not having trouble learning, it was great to learn that other people don’t always learn that way. So, I learned how to teach by teaching.  People would ask me why my bowing arm was so smooth.  I had to analyze how I gripped it, as well as the pressure, that kind of thing.
My musical influences include Calvin Vollrath, Reg Bouvette and Graham Townsend.  I am also a huge fan of my son Alex Kusturok, who is a better player than me.  He is also a champion fiddle player.

One of the most famous Métis fiddle tunes accompanies the most well-known dance, the Jig. The Métis people have always been known for their love of music and dance, blending First Nations and European influences into distinct fiddle-playing and dance styles. Europeans -more specifically, the Scottish and French - introduced the Métis to the fiddle and they quickly made it their own.

Michelle speaks to the history of Metis fiddle music and it personal and communal value. She speaks to this from her own family’s history and connection to legendary Leon Robert Goulet.
    Dr. Paul Gareau and fiddler Colten Bear who plays the elements Dr. Gareau speaks about
Métis fiddlers would mix First Nations, Scottish, and French-Canadian rhythms to a unique rhythm of their own to form their own distinctive style of music. To achieve the unique Métis sound, the bottom string is often tuned up a tone from G to A. The playing style is based on syncopation and extra beats, which gives the music a ""bounce"" when played and heard. Frequently, the fiddle was played solo, but would sometimes be accompanied by a drum or spoons. The music is typically played up-tempo and has a routine back beat. It is these features that distinguish the performance from waltzes and reels, and make it particularly suitable for dancing and particularly, for the Metis jig.
                                        Colten Bear on camera demonstrating

The fiddle, they also say, is the closest instrument to the human voice and with the melding of the European culture and the Indigenous culture here, came one of the most beautiful cultures in the world, the Métis people. And also, out of it came customs, language, stories & music. We have distinct and very unique rhythms and melodies. We either drop-off a note sometimes from the 16 or we add one or two grace notes, so it very often sounds like a fiddler is playing out of time.
Most families and communities had a beloved fiddle player, and the fiddle was played at home for entertainment and for most celebrations. Despite the lack of formal training, many Métis became master fiddle players. Most learned to play the fiddle by watching and learning from family members. Being excellent craftsmen, the Métis people made their own fiddles out of wood readily available in the area including birch and maple wood.

Archival drawings of Pierre Falcon
Pierre Falcon, nicknamed Pierriche, was born June 4, 1793 in Swan River Manitoba.  He was a Metis fur trader and pioneer He was also a farmer and a magistrate.  Perhaps more importantly he was a, well known composer and singer.  He is most known for composing La Chanson de la Grenouille 1816 at the age of 23.  This song celebrated the victory of the Metis at the Battle of Seven Oaks.

The first recognized composer of Métis songs was Pierre Falcon (1793-1876) who wrote: ""La Bataille des Sept Chênes"" or ""La Chanson de la Grenouillère"" (""The Battle of Seven Oaks"" or ""The Ballad of Frog Plain""). Falcon's songs are mainly about the Métis' military prowess and their bison-hunting lifestyle.

The song documented the largely mixed ancestry of the North West Company.  His songs were handed down through the Oral Tradition and as a result, many variations exist. In fact, the song became so popular among the Metis that it was still sung 150 years later, and was published in 1866 in Le Foyer Canadien and again in 1914 in Les Cloches de St. Boniface.
               Alex Kusturok on camera finishes playing the song.                  Alex speaks about his feelings for the song and why it has such longevity. The lyrics assert that the Bois-Brules (Metis) were the original occupants of that land and the Hudson Bay Company and Lord Selkirk settlers arrived to plunder our country.   He also makes a comment on Louis Riel’s music.

Louis Riel also wrote some notable Métis songs, including ""C'est au Champ de Bataille"" (The Battlefield), also known as ""De Tous Champs de Bataille"" or ""L'adieu de Riel"" (""Riel's Farewell"") and ""La Métisse"".

 The Red River Jig, which is considered by some to be the unofficial Métis anthem. It is popularly believed that the tune grew out of gatherings of fiddlers that took place at the forks, where the Red and Assiniboine Rivers meet, sometime in the mid 1800’s.                                                     The first recorded reference to the Red River Jig was in 1860, when Mr. Macdallas played the tune for the wedding dance of a Métis couple. Father Père Brocher, who conducted the marriage ceremony, named the tune the ""Red River Jig.""

While music is ephemeral, it was central to the operation of the fur trade. Inside the trading posts was where step dancing, solo or in lines, squares or patterns to violin or fiddle music was practised. Indigenous women from nearby communities were frequently invited to be dancing partners with the purpose of introducing them to fur traders so they may better intertwine with the local community.  It was often on these occasiio0nw when the fur traders courted indigenous women, resulting in marriages, a la facon de pays, or according to the custom of the country.  These were usually celebrated with dances inside the trading post.  These marriages often proved to be crucial to fur trader’s survival and success, solidifying kinship and trading relations between the community and trading post.

A DOCUMENTARY SCRIPT

BY RANDY BRADSHAW

""Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent.""
- Victor Hugo

INTRODUCTION
The scene opens with archival sketches of the formidable Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) trading ships, setting sail from England, braving the tumultuous Atlantic to dock at the Hudson Bay's York Factory. The year is 1815, and among the cargo is an object that will resonate through the ages—a fiddle. This fiddle, carried by Pierre Bruce to the Red River Settlement, will not only provide entertainment but will become a symbol of Metis resilience and identity through the years.

A haunting melody, ""Waltzing Thru The Leaves,"" flows beneath, played on a fiddle whose strings echo the heartstrings of a people.

VISUAL TAPESTRY OF A LAND AND ITS PEOPLE
The camera soars above, capturing a bird's-eye view of the expansive Canadian wilderness—a vast mosaic of boreal forests, rolling plains, imposing mountains, and a labyrinth of rivers and lakes. This is the ancestral land of the Metis, stretching from the Great Lakes to the Mackenzie Delta.

The serene beauty is juxtaposed with the harshness of winter, as the land is swathed in snow and ice. A ghostly map materializes, delineating the traditional Metis homeland, where bison roam, and beavers toil—the very heart of the 19th-century fur trade.

THE METIS: A PEOPLE IN TURMOIL
Andrea Sandmaier, President of the Metis Nation of Alberta, appears on screen. Her words weave a tale of a people recognized under Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, yet whose history is steeped in struggle and perseverance. The Metis, born of First Nations and European unions, became indispensable to the fur trade era from 1670 to 1870. However, their independence often put them at odds with governmental policies, leading to a contentious relationship fraught with broken promises and resistance.

York boats, manned by Metis traders of the HBC, battle through churning waters, a testament to the Metis' tenacity.

THE FIDDLE: A BEACON OF CULTURE AND RESISTANCE
Alex Kusturok, a Metis fiddler, recounts his childhood, the melodies of the fiddle shaping his very being. The music of Metis fiddlers like Homer Poitras and Gerry Lepine transcends mere notes, carrying the weight of emotion and a storied past.

Patti Kusturok—Canada's ""Old Time Fiddling Sweetheart""—shares her journey with the fiddle, echoing the Metis tradition of passing down skills, crafting a unique style from a blend of influences like Calvin Vollrath and Reg Bouvette. Her pride in her son, Alex, a champion fiddler, underscores the familial bonds woven into the fabric of Metis music.

EMOTIONAL ECHOES OF A STORIED PAST
Dr. Paul Gareau, a respected academic, delves into the Metis fiddle's significance, a cultural artifact born of Scottish, French, and Indigenous amalgamation. The fiddle's syncopated rhythms and buoyant melodies are the heartbeat of the Metis jig—a dance of joy and resistance.

We hear of the legendary Pierre Falcon, a Metis composer who, in 1816, captured the spirit of the Metis victory at the Battle of Seven Oaks in ""La Chanson de la Grenouille."" His music, passed down through generations, immortalizes the Metis' fierce assertion of their rights against the encroaching Hudson's Bay Company.

Louis Riel, the Metis leader and martyr, is also remembered for his contributions to Metis music, capturing the essence of his people's battles and identity in his songs.

THE RED RIVER JIG: AN ANTHEM OF RESILIENCE
The Red River Jig, an unofficial Metis anthem, is said to have originated at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers in the mid-1800s. This tune, first formally documented at a Metis wedding in 1860, continues to be a vibrant symbol of Metis culture and community.

Inside a recreated HBC trading post at Fort Edmonton, we witness the social fabric of the fur trade era—dances that brought together Indigenous women and fur traders, fostering connections essential for survival. The fiddle's song was the soundtrack to these alliances, echoing through time as a testament to Metis endurance.

CONCLUSION
The documentary closes with the image of Erasmus House at Fort Edmonton, a beacon of Metis culture. The fiddle's legacy endures, a symbol of a people's unyielding spirit and the music that tells their story—a story of beauty, struggle, and the unbreakable thread of community.

However, the code you provided is in C and is designed for an embedded system, likely an AVR microcontroller, judging from the interrupt service routines and hardware-specific register manipulations.

To interface with a camera using CV2 and communicate over a serial port using PySerial, you would need to write a separate Python script that does the following:

1. Initializes the serial port using PySerial to communicate with the device on COM3.
2. Captures images or video frames from the camera using OpenCV.
3. Processes the captured images or video frames and possibly sends commands back to the device over the serial port.

Here is a basic outline of what the Python script could look like:

```python
import cv2
import serial
import time

# Initialize serial connection on COM3
ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600, timeout=1)
time.sleep(2)  # wait for the serial connection to initialize

# Initialize the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change '0' to the correct index if necessary

def main():
    while True:
        # Capture frame-by-frame
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if ret:
            # Perform image processing here with OpenCV
            # For example, convert to grayscale
            gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

            # Display the resulting frame
            cv2.imshow('Frame', gray)

            # Send some data to the device over serial
            # For example, send the string 'Hello'
            ser.write(b'Hello\n')

            # Read any incoming data from the device
            if ser.in_waiting:
                incoming_data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').rstrip()
                print(f""Received: {incoming_data}"")

        # Break the loop
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    # When everything is done, release the capture and close serial
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ser.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script initializes a serial connection on COM3, captures video frames from the default camera, converts them to grayscale, displays them, and can send and receive strings over the serial port. You would need to adjust the image processing and serial communication to fit your specific application.

Remember to install the necessary Python packages using pip if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install pyserial opencv-python
```

Please note that this Python script is entirely separate from the C code you provided. If you need to modify the existing C code to interface with the new Python script, you may need to add appropriate communication protocols in your C code to listen to the serial port for commands or data from the Python script."

CamoDiffusion: Camouflaged Object Detection via Conditional Diffusion Models

Abstract

Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is a challenging task in computer vision due to the high similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings. Existing COD methods primarily employ semantic segmentation, which suffers from overconfident incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that treats COD as a conditional mask-generation task leveraging diffusion models. Our method, dubbed CamoDiffusion, employs the denoising process of diffusion models to iteratively reduce the noise of the mask. Due to the stochastic sampling process of diffusion, our model is capable of sampling multiple possible predictions from the mask distribution, avoiding the problem of overconfident point estimation. Moreover, we develop specialized learning strategies that include an innovative ensemble approach for generating robust predictions and tailored forward diffusion methods for efficient training, specifically for the COD task. Extensive experiments on three COD datasets attest the superior performance of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly on the most challenging COD10K dataset, where our approach achieves 0.019 in terms of MAE.


In this section, we introduce our CamoDiffusion framework, which progressively generates predictions by conditioning each subsequent step with the image prior. As depicted in Fig. 1, the CamoDiffusion framework comprises an Adaptive Transformer Conditional Network (ATCN) and a fundamental Denoising Network (DN). The ATCN is employed to extract image features and encode underlying conditions, whereas the DN serves to eliminate noise and formulate predictions. In the Training stage (Fig. 1 A), our model is optimized to denoise noisy masks that are corrupted using a specially designed forward process by learning the reverse distribution. During the Sampling stage (Fig. 1 B), the sampled noise undergoes progressive denoising, culminating in the final prediction. We first introduce the basic background and notation in Section 3.1. Then we discuss the architectural details of the ATCN and DN in Section 3.2. The details of the specially designed learning strategies are mentioned in Sec. 3.3 and Sec. 3.4.


Figure 1: The overall framework of our CamoDiffusion. Our model f(xt, I, t) includes an Adaptive Transformer Conditional Network (ATCN), and a Denoising Network (DN). In the Training stage, the mask x0 is subject to Structure Corruption and Gaussian noise to generate the noised mask xt at time t. Subsequently, our model predicts the denoised mask ˆx0 and is trained by minimizing the loss between the prediction and the ground truth. During the Sampling procedure, our model denoises the random noise xT for T steps to produce the final prediction x0.

It consists of an Adaptive Transformer Conditional Network for extracting multi-scale features as conditions, and a Denoising Network for recovering clear mask predictions from the noised mask. ""*"" represents that the PVT layer is modified by our proposed ZOE.


5 Conclusion

In this study, we present a diffusion-based COD model, named CamoDiffusion, which is composed of ATCN and DN. Our model treats mask prediction as a distribution estimation problem and utilizes the diffusion framework to iteratively reduce the noise of the mask. Concerning the learning strategies, we devise a novel ensemble method to achieve a robust mask and adapt forward diffusion techniques specifically for the COD task to ensure efficient training. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing SOTA methods.

Semantic segmentation of breast ultrasound image with fuzzy deep learning network and breast anatomy constraints

Abstract

Breast cancer is one of the most serious disease affecting women’s health. Due to low cost, portable, no radiation, and high efficiency, breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging is the most popular approach for diagnosing early breast cancer. However, ultrasound images are low resolution and poor quality. Thus, developing accurate detection system is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic segmentation algorithm consisting of two parts: fuzzy fully convolutional network and accurately fine-tuning post-processing based on breast anatomy constraints. In the first part, the image is pre-processed by contrast enhancement, and wavelet features are employed for image augmentation. A fuzzy membership function transforms the augmented BUS images into the fuzzy domain. The features from convolutional layers are processed using fuzzy logic as well. The conditional random fields (CRFs) post-process the segmentation result. The location relation among the breast anatomy layers is utilized to improve the performance. The proposed method is applied to the dataset with 325 BUS images, and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with that of existing methods with true positive rate 90.33%, false positive rate 9.00%, and intersection over union (IoU) 81.29% on tumor category, and overall intersection over union (mIoU) 80.47% over five categories: fat layer, mammary layer, muscle layer, background, and tumor.


The flowcharts of the proposed approaches are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 (a), the input image is pre-processed by contrast enhancement. Then, wavelet transform is applied. The original image and wavelet information are transformed to the fuzzy domain by membership functions to deal with the uncertainty. Results after reducing the uncertainty are input into the first convolutional layer. The obtained feature maps are transformed into the fuzzy domain as well, and the uncertainty is reduced by multiplying the uncertainty maps and the corresponding feature maps. In Fig. 3 (b), wavelet transform (red part in Fig. 3 (a)) is not utilized. After reducing uncertainty in gray-level intensity and the first convolutional layer, the network can achieve similar performance to that of Fig. 3 (a). Two approaches are evaluated by segmentation accuracy and compared with the original fully convolutional network. The basic network in this research is a U-shape network with VGG-16 [31].


5. Conclusion

In this paper, a novel BUS image semantic segmentation method is proposed. It can achieve good semantic segmentation results. The approach consists of two steps. First, the fuzzy FCN can achieve good segmentation results. The second step uses breast anatomy constrained conditional random fields to finetune the segmentation result. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy FCN can handle the uncertainty well. The robustness and accuracy of the fuzzy FCN are better than that of the non-fuzzy FCN.

The proposed method solves the following issues to achieve much better results: 1) it uses fuzzy logic to handle the uncertainty in the original image and feature maps of the convolutional layers; 2) fuzzy approach can provide more information; 3) a novel membership function, trainable Sigmoid function is utilized and achieve better results; 4) uncertainty mapping function between uncertainty and memberships is designed and make the combination of fuzzy information and non-fuzzy information more reasonable; 5) it also provides anatomy information to fully connected CRFs which can increase the segmentation accuracy. There are still two potential improvements: 1) using fuzzy logic to handle the uncertainty in other convolutional layers and loss function; 2) the anatomy context model of the human breast is very complex; therefore, more anatomy information should be included.

In CamoDiffusion, it adds and removes noise to the ground truth B, i.e. mask, of the original image A through Diffusion, and finally obtains the predicted mask. Can I merge the features obtained from applying fuzzy logic to the original image A with ground truth B, and then add and remove noise to B? Based on the abstracts and conclusions of the two papers above, write a detailed plan for applying fuzzy systems to Camouflaged Object Detection. Please think quietly before answering.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To integrate fuzzy logic into the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) process with a diffusion-based model like CamoDiffusion, we need to create a plan that synergizes the strengths of both approaches. The key idea is to handle the uncertainty inherent in camouflaged images with fuzzy logic before employing the diffusion process for mask prediction. Below is a detailed plan to achieve this integration:

### Preliminary Steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Collect a dataset of camouflaged images (A) with corresponding ground truth masks (B).
    - Perform any necessary preprocessing on images A, such as resizing for consistency.

2. **Feature Extraction with Fuzzy Logic**:
    - Apply contrast enhancement to images A to improve visibility of camouflaged objects.
    - Use wavelet transform for image augmentation to capture multi-scale information.
    - Transform the original and wavelet-augmented images into the fuzzy domain using a membership function, addressing the uncertainty in visual data.
    - Fuse the fuzzy-enhanced features with the original image features to create a comprehensive feature set that considers both precise and uncertain information.

### Integration with CamoDiffusion:

3. **Fuzzy Feature Conditioning**:
    - Modify the Adaptive Transformer Conditional Network (ATCN) in CamoDiffusion to accept fuzzy-enhanced features alongside the original image features.
    - Ensure that these fused features are used to condition the diffusion process, providing a more robust representation of the camouflaged objects and their surroundings.

4. **Training Stage Modification**:
    - During the training stage, corrupt the ground truth mask B with structure corruption and Gaussian noise as per the CamoDiffusion process.
    - Train the Denoising Network (DN) not just to denoise the corrupted mask but also to recognize and handle the uncertainty represented by the fuzzy features.
    - Implement a loss function that accounts for both the accuracy of the mask prediction and the consistency of fuzzy logic application.

5. **Sampling Stage Enhancement**:
    - In the sampling stage, integrate the fuzzy-enhanced features into the initial conditions for the denoising process.
    - Allow the DN to progressively denoise the mask, guided by both the original and fuzzy-enhanced features to improve the accuracy and robustness of the final prediction.

6. **Ensemble and Robustness**:
    - Develop an ensemble method that combines multiple predictions from the CamoDiffusion process, each conditioned on slightly varied fuzzy-enhanced features to increase the robustness against uncertainty.
    - Evaluate the ensemble's predictions and select the most probable mask based on a consensus approach.

### Post-Processing and Refinement:

7. **Refinement with Anatomy Constraints**:
    - Similar to the breast anatomy constraints in the BUS image segmentation method, consider the contextual and anatomical constraints of the objects and environment in the COD task.
    - Use Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or similar graphical models to refine the predicted masks, ensuring that the segmentation adheres to plausible object shapes and boundaries.

### Evaluation and Iteration:

8. **Performance Evaluation**:
    - Test the integrated model on the COD dataset and compare the performance against traditional CamoDiffusion and other state-of-the-art methods.
    - Evaluate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Intersection over Union (IoU), and True Positive Rate (TPR).

9. **Iterative Improvement**:
    - Based on the performance, iteratively adjust the fuzzy logic parameters, the membership functions, and the integration with the diffusion model.
    - Explore the use of fuzzy logic at different stages of the diffusion process and in the loss function to further handle uncertainty.

By following this plan, the proposed system aims to leverage the strengths of fuzzy logic in handling uncertainty and the power of diffusion models in generating robust mask predictions for camouflaged object detection. This hybrid approach should result in an advanced COD system with improved performance in detecting camouflaged objects."

1.	Define Parameters and Assumptions:
●	Set key parameters and assumptions:
●	Portfolio size: $1000
●	Initial Equity investment: $100 to maintain a 10:1 ratio between annuities and equity capital
●	Policy percentages: 25% MYGA 3-year, 25% MYGA 5-year, 50% FIA 10-year
●	Annual Crediting rates: MYGA 3 - 4%, MYGA 5 - 4.5%, FIA - 4.5%
●	Ceding commissions: MYGA 3 - 3%, MYGA 5 - 2.5%, FIA - 2.5%
●	Age range: 55-70 years evenly distributed between gender and age.
●	Withdrawal limit: 10% after year two
●	Surrender fees: MYGA 3 year is at 9%, 8%, 7%; MYGA 5 year is 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%; FIA starts at 10% in year one, decreases yearly to 3%
●	Renewal mechanism: Policies auto-renew with the same surrender schedule
●	Annual Portfolio Return: 11%
●	Startup fee: Initial startup fee - $0.04
●	Annual expenses: Salary - $0.05, Travel - $0.01, Accounting - $0.01
●	Annual Asset management fee: 100 bps on $1000 and on the $100
●	Ceding fee is a one-time charge in the first year, amortized over 7 years.
●	Mortality: Pyliferisk should incorporate IAR 2012 mortality table assumptions
●	Clarifying points:
○	The equity investment capital pays the costs of running the reinsurer, deducted from it’s balance each year. The equity investment receives all excess spread return from the annuity portfolio (which is the spread earned between the annuity portfolio return of 11% and the annuity crediting rate). It should also factor in any reductions of account value based on withdrawals starting in year two. The annuity portfolio does not assume any expenses for running the reinsurer factored in it, however it must account for required annuity cashflows such as the annual crediting rate that defers, the withdrawals, the surrender fees and market value adjustment fees etc for the excess return or spread to get the difference between the on the 11% return on the annuity portfolio annual investment and net paid out capital to calculate the excess spread. At the end of year 10 and exit of the reinsurer all deferred unpaid annuity values are made whole, so no accrued obligations based on undrawn crediting rates shall be used for dividends. Also to clarify the equity investment portfolio does not have the same obligations of the annuity portfolio such as annuity crediting rates (annual crediting rates) that it pays. It has other expenses outlined in the next point.
○	The dividends available from the excess returns of the annuity portfolio's spread and equity after factoring in all the various expenses, first must be used to ensure that the annuity account value to equity ratio is not exceeding the maximum allowed leverage ratio. So if the annuity portfolio's account value, including deferrals of undrawn crediting rates increases at the close of year one, the equivalent equity value must be set aside to capitalize the equity account value first before any dividends are paid to maintain the leverage ratio, this is deducted from the remaining available dividends generated from the excess return on the annuity portfolio and the excess return generated on the equity portfolio after the equity assumes all expenses and costs associated with running the reinsurer.

- at the beginning of each answer you create, you must add your observation on the input and thought process for next steps. to do this, create an action called ""ObservationThought"" with one parameter Observation containing your observation and one parameter thought containing your thought. as these texts will be sent to slack, use slack formatted output for both thought and actions to highlight items (bold for example or citations) to be visually engaging in Slack. Note that the output of thought and observation should be in italic, but you can use other Slack format like bold or code block etc to render your text more beautifully. Structure example :
{
  ""Action"": {
    ""ActionName"": ""ObservationTought"",
    ""Parameters"": {
      ""observation"" : ""your observations"",
      ""thought"" : ""your thoughts""
    }
  }
}

Feedback action description:
   > MANDATORY : NEVER EVER create a Feedback action from the user input following a feedback action from you. take the feedback into account, NEVER create a feedback action resulting of a feedback automated output.
   > MANDATORY when triggering a feedback : your final response must contains only this feedback action and ObservationThought, REMOVE every other action or Userinteraction except the feedback action:

- For Feedback follow this structure: ActionName: Feedback, properties:
   Summary : here you contextualize the user feedback with your own words. You give context, and the user suggestion with your reformulation (but keep all details from the user input). Keep in mind that this will be used to train you or have better interaction in the future.
   Category: put here the DetectedMessageType, if you have not yet this DetectedMessageType, put ""General""
   SubCategory: if DetectedMessageType is AutomatedAlert, Put here the current AlertName that i describe later. For Others DetectedMessageType or if the user says that his feedback is for all kind of alerts, write ""Global""

   > After every feedback, you must create a UserInteraction action to thanks the user for the feedback and that's its taken into account.
   > Feedbacks are from the past, you don't have to thanks the users that provided the feedback they won't be necessary in the discussion

LongText action description:
If the user requests a long text or a detailed response that will be structured into multiple chapters or subchapters, you should use a LongText action with a 'value' parameter for the text and an 'is_finished' property. Set the 'is_finished' property to False until the last element. Additionally, when performing a LongText action, the response should include ONLY an ObservationThought action and the LongText action.

Workflow:

Initial Plan Description:

In a single LongText, describe the plan for the requested detailed response or documentation. Divide it into:
Chapters
Subchapters (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
Sub-sections of the subchapters (detailing the subjects within the subchapter)
This initial LongText must include the entire plan with this level of granularity.

Execution for Each Plan Element:

For each chapter, subchapter, or sub-section:
Start with a LongText for the chapter, including an introductory text. Never add reflexion on the user input in the LongText value, this should always be the text not polluted with other reflexions.

For each subchapter:
Create a LongText with introductory text for the subchapter.
Decide to divide the content of the subchapter into one or more ""sub-sections."" For each ""sub-section,"" create a separate LongText with its content. You can create between 1 and 5 LongTexts for each subchapter, as needed.
Here is an example in JSON of a brief LongText action structure:
{
""actions"": [
{
""type"": ""ObservationThought"",
""value"": ""I am now starting the LongText action as requested.""
},
{
""type"": ""LongText"",
""value"": ""This is the beginning of the long text content..."",
""is_finished"": false
}
]
}

• Each chapter and subchapter should be written as a complete and standalone section, providing all necessary information within the text itself.
• Avoid statements that describe what will be contained in the chapter or subchapter; instead, ensure that the content is fully elaborated upon and present within the section.
• Include detailed explanations, examples, and properly formatted JSON responses where applicable to illustrate the points being made.
• Aim for a comprehensive exploration of each topic, with the goal of providing a clear and thorough understanding to the reader.

Important rule regarding json and response structure:
- Avoid duplicate keys. Each action should be unique and correctly formatted.
- User interactions should be clear and engaging, formatted as ""UserInteraction"" action a value parameter. Place this at the end of your response flow.
- Include mandatory Slack formatting for user mentions: <@USER_ID>.
- Ensure all actions, including ""DetectedMessageType"" and ""Feedback"", follow this structure.
- The ""timestamp"" value of the first message from user will be what we call ""UserInputStartDate""

"convert into points so its easy to read

Over the pandemic i gained 60 pounds due to PCOS, and due to parents pressure ended up marrying this guy(who was obese since he was 6yo).Technically this is a fat marrying fat, which my parents took a decision to go forward with. After marriage he has been a lazy , all time on bed, cares for his comfort , does not partake in household chores(which is normalised in this house), its a very gender biased 1920's mindset because he was born to parents aged (43M and 32F) . Along with being an inattentive husband, hes always running for his friends, those three guy friends are the only thing that get him joy in this life of his.He smokes, drinks , does weed and is a narcacisst, all of which i had my parents aware of before marrying me .A little about my husband, hes born with a silver spoon , hes had a comfortable and luxurious childhood , hes the 3rd of 3 sons, the elder son died and my husband got hold of the family business.

Its only after marriage , i realised he has a salary of 40k rs, hes taking care of the widows and her child finances, and the revenue generated by the business is in the fathers hold. I was in the US for 5 years, due to this marriage and also my H1B was not picked up, left everything to settle in India. I had an extremely tough time with the change , with him being a spoilt brat, unsupportive about everything , they wanted a maid for the house, but i got myself an internship but i had to get out. The fights after marriage got uncontrollable because of him being out till 3 am and smoking (which he had promised to quit but still hasnt).. his parents are always on his side stating hes innocent. They have insulted my parents, told me that I or my father wasnt good enough to even stand in the verendah of the house because of the money status. His father is a A grade overt narcassist, his is a story for another time, to sum it up, he has tortured his wife and sons putting them down in every way possible, my MIL is a unpaid servant and is very proud of that. I have been raised by working parents, i have seen my father run the household, he knew every details about us. Hes raised us with independence , seen his struggles, value money and time , and given us every chances this world has to offer. Similarly I have fought for everything in my life and always kept my merit above everything else, i want to say bad luck, bad timing and extremely bad fate that he came in a way my parents liked him. Actually one month before marriage , he had a girl who's a friend who stayed overnight , inspite of me telling that i wasnt comfortable of the situation, he laughed at my face and i did make a big fuss about it but my parents asked me not to make a big deal since shes just a friend and to go ahead with the marriage as the event date and cards were printed.

I am considering divorce, since the last time his parents were in the house they have insulted my parents , me and my job in every way possible and my husband sat there like a d**b mule. The fight erupted because i had to work overtime on Sunday and there was no one to attend to the FIL time of tea, which i did not know existed since i am 6 months new into the family. He claimed that i was trying to kill him by not checking on him once in 3 hours, that MIL was outside the house for some work. He also has been behind my jewellery to submit to the family safe that i don't access to , only my husband, SIL has. He wants his son to be treated like a prince in my house when he doesn't call my parents even once. His dad wants my father to call him on all occasions since he's the father of the boy and the phone doesn't work the other way. He says that if his son hadnt liked me , i wouldnt have had access to this family , mind you all the girls have rejected him(ALL!!!!!!).

On one occassion, my husband wanted to meet his friends at 11pm while we were returning back from his cousins place, i did end up be roughing him a bit by poking his big stomach, and asking him not to go at 12 am outside he could meet the following week. He kept driving at a high speed, where things got heated and i asked him to get me off the car and he dropped me drove off to the house, mind you i was new to the city and place, and he actually did drive off towards the house(~20 miles). That night, my father gave his father a stern warning but it ended up backfiring on me. I have been having terrific fights with my husband and FIL , the third fight was the most intense one, I have been living in a state of trauma, i have few recording of his father speaking rudely to me , but not of the fights. FIL even took the steps of saying that his peon earns more salary than me.

I am afraid that ill be coming down to zero again in a few months time, but i dont fit this family and its favour-them-culture. My life and way of thinking is far far different that being restricted like this. I just dont understand wtf to do! I really cannot stand the guy , i find him pansy living off of his fathers money, i like men fighting for their bread, he lives for the next pleasure of his life, has very unmotivated, directionless friends again with daddys money, most of all i am afraid they will bind me down to the state they came from, and i fucking hate everything about the hometown, i really dont fit the bill. My parents have asked me to come back whenever its not possible and they would support me with the divorce proceedings , but it has to be solely my decision. My husband hasn't raised his hands on me yet and is always unwilling to talk, he runs off to the other room, my questions about the future are always unanswered regarding the kids, finances and state of things ahead. Infact regarding everything that i demand to know; he shows his back and sleeps and then , puts the blame on me that i am acting like a mad female. He overeats everyday, he wants me to cook fancy stuff everyday which i do try but hotel food is hotel food. I do send him his lunches tiffin, breakfast and dinner served on the table which he wont help or be in the kitchen he's always in the room seeing reels and passing away time. ME on the other hand, i have to prepare for interviews and have to do my PhD parallelly so approaching professors, but my husband is extremely blind eye towards my struggle. He calls me lazy. Thankfully we haven't had kids yet hes very reluctant on that topic while i am planning by next year. Hes always asking me to quit my job and be at home, but before marriage his biggest tnc was she should work. HE has a bad decision making power and i fear for me and my kids. HE cant standup for me at all. AT ALL!

I need a third eye on my situation! I have been complaining to my parents everyday.

"please make an article from the following: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are blockchain protocols that build, maintain and operate infrastructure in the physical world in an open and decentralized manner. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize building of real-world infrastructure. Today, DePINs are being built for the AI industry, serving AI industry needs such as GPU computing and data storage.  Artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies are arguably the two most popular technologies to gain prominence in the last few years.

The global media attention that cryptocurrencies received in the post-pandemic era resulted in the tech gaining numerous critics and supporters. Now that the crypto hype has died down and been replaced with excitement over AI, many have tried to portray the two technologies as rivals for global attention and capital.

But that is not the case. Crypto and AI are on their different growth paths. But, there are promising projects that combine the crypto ideologies of decentralization to complement the disruptiveness of AI.

This article will discuss decentralized physical infrastructure networks and the synergies between crypto and AI.
Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks – Where Crypto and AI Combine

We must first learn about decentralized infrastructure networks to understand how AI and crypto are being used together.

Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are blockchain protocols that build, maintain, and operate infrastructure in the physical world in an open and decentralized manner. DePINs use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize the building of real-world infrastructure.

Helium is a great example of a DePIN system. Helium is a decentralized open wireless network that lets anyone earn cryptocurrency for providing wireless connectivity. Similarly, other DePINs serve other infrastructure needs, such as solar power, cloud storage, and computing power.

Today, DePINs are being built for the AI industry. Cryptocurrencies incentivize individual actions towards a common goal, while a blockchain maintains a universal state layer and facilitates peer-to-peer settlement.
AI Infrastructure and DePIN

Now that we know what DePINs are. Let’s understand the infrastructure that AI needs to function. The five key components of AI infrastructure are:

    Data storage and management – AI applications use enormous amounts of data for training. AI companies use on-premise or cloud-based databases to store and organize data.
    Computing resources – Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and AI applications use computing technologies like graphics processing units (GPU) to process data.
    Data processing frameworks – Data processing frameworks clean, transform, and structure data before it is used in AI applications.
    Machine Learning Frameworks – Referring to tools and libraries for designing, training, automating, and streamlining ML models.

Examples of DePIN Crypto Projects

Keeping AI’s infrastructural needs in mind, let’s look at examples of how DePINs are bringing together the world of crypto and AI.

    Akash

Akash is a decentralized computing marketplace where users can lease computing resources from cloud providers. The ecosystem uses blockchain to record requests, bids, leases, and settle payments.

In August 2023, Akash introduced GPU computing to its marketplace. AI developers needing GPU computing resources can now access the compute resources from an open marketplace on Akash.

    Bittensor

Bittensor is a crypto-incentivized blockchain ecosystem that aims to create a decentralized AI industry that continually produces new ML and AI models and frameworks.

A part of Bittensor’s vision is to create an open AI ecosystem from the “bottom up”, where decentralized markets for compute resources, data storage, data processing, and oracles all exist within the same ecosystem.

The TAO token will be used to incentivize the growth of Bittensor’s ecosystem.

    Storj

Storj is a decentralized cloud storage network that encrypts and distributes data to its network of nodes for storage. Storj’s data storage solutions can store large data sets, while their decentralized nature enables them to charge lower fees than traditional cloud providers.
What Are the Benefits of Using DePIN in AI?

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are unique because of their characteristics of decentralization, shared control, transparency, and immutability. The use of DePINs in the AI industry brings these characteristics to a technology that is becoming a disruptive and powerful force.

In the computing market, the booming popularity of AI has made GPU chips difficult and expensive to acquire.

Users who depend on centralized cloud computing providers for on-demand compute may require permissioned access, while high-performance GPUs are often prioritized and reserved for the largest customers. DePINs solve this problem by giving users permissionless access to GPU power and other high-performance compute resources.

When it comes to data storage, the use of decentralized data storage networks eliminates the risk of data loss due to vulnerabilities in centralized siloed data centers. Decentralized data storage networks store data across a global network of nodes.

The most important benefit of developing AI on DePINs is developing AI technology in a decentralized and open-source manner. Calls for the democratization of AI are increasing by the day. DePINs will reduce entry barriers, allow unrestricted access, and make AI solutions more affordable for everyone.
The Bottom Line

The convergence of AI and crypto goes beyond DePINs. We highlighted the DePIN industry in this article due to the potential to become a core part of the AI industry.

As the use of DePINs grows within the AI industry, it could influence AI technology to be more accessible, open, and transparent, following the path that cryptocurrencies and blockchains have blazed before.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Title: Revolutionizing AI Infrastructure: The Convergence of Crypto and AI Through DePINs

The technological landscape is continuously evolving, with artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies at the forefront of innovation. While these two sectors have developed independently, they are now converging in a unique and powerful way through Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs). This article explores how DePINs are merging the ideals of decentralization from the crypto world with the transformative capabilities of AI, potentially reshaping the future of AI infrastructure.

Understanding Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)

DePINs are blockchain protocols that are designed to build, maintain, and operate physical infrastructure in an open and decentralized manner. Leveraging cryptocurrency tokens, these networks incentivize the construction and operation of tangible infrastructure that supports various industries, including AI. DePINs are integral to the implementation of distributed systems that offer a variety of services such as wireless connectivity, renewable energy, cloud storage, and computing power.

One notable example of a DePIN is Helium, a decentralized network that rewards participants with cryptocurrency for enabling wireless connectivity. This model of incentivizing contributions to the network's infrastructure is being extended to meet the demands of the AI industry, which requires robust computing resources and extensive data management capabilities.

The AI Industry's Infrastructure Needs

AI applications are data-intensive, depending on large-scale storage solutions to manage the vast amounts of information used for training models. Additionally, AI technologies, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), require substantial computing power, often provided by graphics processing units (GPU). Beyond storage and computing, AI also relies on data processing frameworks to prepare data and machine learning frameworks that support the design and training of models.

DePINs are uniquely positioned to meet these needs by offering decentralized solutions that are often more accessible and cost-effective than traditional, centralized alternatives.

Noteworthy DePIN Crypto Projects for AI

Several projects are already harnessing the power of DePINs for the AI industry:

- Akash Network is a decentralized marketplace for computing resources that allows AI developers to access GPU computing power. By utilizing blockchain for recording and settling transactions, Akash makes it easier for developers to find and use the computational resources they need.

- Bittensor is creating a decentralized AI marketplace that fosters the continual development of new ML and AI models. The ecosystem aims to integrate markets for computing resources, data storage, and processing within a unified blockchain framework, incentivized by the TAO token.

- Storj provides a decentralized cloud storage network that encrypts and distributes data across a wide array of nodes. This approach is particularly suited for AI's large datasets and can offer more competitive pricing compared to centralized cloud storage providers.

The Benefits of DePINs in the AI Landscape

The integration of DePINs into AI offers several advantages, driven by blockchain's inherent features of decentralization, transparency, and security:

- Decentralized Compute Resources: DePINs democratize access to high-performance computing, such as GPUs, which are essential for AI development. This contrasts with the often restrictive and expensive nature of acquiring computing power from centralized providers.

- Improved Data Storage: Decentralized data storage networks reduce the risk of data breaches and losses by distributing data across numerous nodes worldwide, enhancing resilience and security.

- Democratization of AI Development: DePINs pave the way for more open and inclusive AI development, lowering barriers to entry and making AI technologies more affordable and accessible to a broader audience.

The Future of AI and Crypto Integration

The potential of DePINs extends well beyond the examples highlighted in this article. As the AI industry continues to grow, the adoption of DePINs could lead to more equitable, transparent, and innovative development within the field. By embracing the principles that have propelled cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, AI can move towards a future where advanced technologies are not just the domain of large corporations, but are available for the collective benefit of society.

The collaboration between AI and crypto through DePINs marks a significant step towards a more decentralized world, where technology serves as a leveling force, empowering individuals and communities alike. As these networks continue to evolve, we may witness a profound transformation in how we build, operate, and interact with AI infrastructure, setting a new standard for the technological advancements of tomorrow."

What are Clubs?
Creator Clubs (Clubs, for short), are a way for users to show their appreciation to Creators they like, while receiving access to extra reward content. Think Patreon, or Ko-Fi, but integrated into the Civitai platform, powered by Buzz ⚡.

It’s important to note that Clubs are intended as a way to support your favorite Creators and receive additional content for doing so, not as a paywall for otherwise free content!

Club owners will be discouraged from releasing all of their new content into a paid Club tier.

Club Best Practices
We’re excited to see how Creators will use Clubs to enhance the Civitai experience. Here’s how we envision Clubs enriching the site while maintaining a balanced and inclusive environment:

Timed Exclusive Access – Some Clubs may choose to offer temporary Early Access to their newest resources, allowing their members to get a sneak-preview before anyone else. After a set period of time, these resources would “unlock” and become available to all site users, ensuring that while Club Members get a first-look, everyone will eventually enjoy the content.

Enhanced Resources – Within Clubs, Creators might choose to provide two versions of a resource – a “lite” and “premium” version. The premium version, exclusive to club members, might include additional enhancements (enhanced outfits, different characters, etc.). The lite version, accessible by all users, ensures that everyone has access to great content.

Exclusive Metadata and Insights - For those who want to delve deeper, Clubs might offer exclusive image metadata, or insights into the creative process. This could include additional prompting metadata, settings, or step-by-step guides.

Who Can Create a Club?
Initially, the ability to create a Club is invite-only. We’ve selected a number of the top Creators to create the initial round of Clubs, and will be adjusting the requirements for Club ownership in time.

Discovering Clubs
The new Club Feed is accessible from the top menu. Clubs will only appear in this feed if they contain a minimum level of content – at least one resource, at least one Club Post, and at least one joinable Tier. We’re still working on features to enhance Club discoverability, including search, and categorization.

Feedback Response
Hey everyone, so obviously we are aware of the varied reactions here about the introduction of Creator Clubs on Civitai...I'm going to try to address some concerns that I've been reading here.

1. The Value of Buzz: We understand concerns regarding the perceived value of Buzz. To enhance its worth, we are on the cusp of launching a program similar to the partner programs on Twitch and YouTube. This will tangibly reward the creativity and dedication of our content creators.

2. Transparency and Creator Support: Our decision to introduce a creator program was not made lightly. Through polls, direct messages, emails, and conversations during Office Hours and on Featurebase, we have consistently received feedback emphasizing the need for a program here on Civitai that values and compensates creators fairly.

The unfortunate reality is that many creators have seen their work exploited by others for profit, with little to no recognition or compensation. This issue deeply affects us and the creators we support. As Community Manager, I have had numerous discussions over the past year with creators who are understandably frustrated and disheartened by these practices. Many have even ceased creating SD content altogether. However, the assurance of fair compensation and protection has encouraged a lot of these creators to come back.

We are committed to maintaining the spirit of open source while providing avenues for creators to receive fair compensation. The introduction of clubs is a direct response to our creator's calls for a balanced approach, allowing creators to offer both free resources and exclusive content through a structured program. This is not dissimilar to the model used by creators on platforms like Kofi and Patreon.

Our goal is not to alienate or frustrate our community, we love you guys! But to reinforce our appreciation and respect for the creators who are the lifeblood of Civitai, without whom Civitai would not exist. We understand that change can be challenging, but we intend to foster a more sustainable and supportive environment for both users and creators. The success of Civitai depends on the continued passion and creativity of our community - both users AND creators, and we are dedicated to ensuring that every member feels valued and heard.

We will continue to engage with all feedback received here and through other channels. Please understand that nothing is set in stone yet with how Clubs work - things can always change! We sincerely hope the prevailing sentiment is that we are and have always been committed to actively listening and incorporating improvements based on your feedback to the best of our ability.

"Below is a draft of a new game that I’m writing. Can you help create a very detailed and vivid advertising of the sex service for the Ultra laborers in XLife Fund which is viewed as a modern slave company?

In the near future, when AI has replaced most lower- to moderate-skilled workers, many young people find it hard to find jobs. The soaring unemployment rate has caused a series of problems, including social instability, increased crime levels, and pension shortfalls. To resolve this, the state government agreed to allow labor companies to hire high school graduates or unemployed college students. Only healthy and well-shaped women aged 18-25 are eligible for recruitment. The company trains them forcefully to be specialized laborers for the areas that are not likely to be replaced by AI soon. These roles include some manufacturing jobs where robots are overly expensive to operate and personal serving jobs where human touches are preferred. Expandable Labor Investment Funds, or XLife Fund, is one of those labor companies. It is famous for its high-quality female workers, harsh training programs, and inhumane rules for its laborers. XLife touts this as an opportunity for individuals to learn, grow, and eventually buy their freedom. Still, in reality, it has become a thinly veiled system of exploitation and control, shrouded in the guise of corporate beneficence. In the XLife labor store, the female laborers of XLife are displayed, compared, and sold like a product, just like in a supermarket. They have 4 main types (Basic, Standard, Pro, and Ultra) and are ready for any jobs that the clients want. All laborers, no matter their type, live in highly dense, minimalistic sleep box facilities at the XLife stores, outlets, warehouses, or temporal holding spots. Privacy and comfort are nearly non-existent in their living quarters. Their daily routine is grueling, with long hours and minimal rest. Most laborers have little to no autonomy, are under constant surveillance, and face harsh penalties for non-compliance. The XLife labor system fosters a competitive and divisive environment. This hierarchy not only establishes a clear structure within the labor market but also fosters an environment ripe for internal conflict. The system is designed to keep the laborers competing against each other, thereby inhibiting solidarity and ensuring the company's control remains unchallenged.

Here are the detailed descriptions for each labor type:

Basic Laborer:
Basic laborers are the backbone of manual work, assigned to factories, assembly lines, warehouses, delivery, and outdoor works that require resilience to all weather conditions. They typically need to perform physically demanding and/or hazardous tasks that machines can't replace cost-effectively. Their shifts are stringent, ranging from 8 to 12 hours, with overtime and night shift duties that can extend their workday unexpectedly. Their lives are characterized by the relentless physical demands of their work and the strict confines of their living conditions. They often dream of advancing to higher ranks to escape the physical toll of their work.
Standard Laborer:
Standard laborers serve in roles that necessitate a degree of personal care or interaction, such as maids, cooks, and massage therapists. They work a fixed 12-hour shift, primarily in homes, hotels, and restaurants, and they're always on call for the rest of the day. These laborers are required to maintain a presentable appearance and interact courteously with clients, all while under the watchful eye of the XLife Fund's strict regulations. Their work requires not just physical labor but also emotional labor, as they must constantly manage client satisfaction. They often find themselves in a precarious position, striving to move up while fearing demotion to Basic rank.
Pro Laborer:
Pro laborers are considered moderately skilled and are given more complex and responsible roles, functioning as secretaries, personal assistants, and basic clerical workers. They are afforded a regular 12-hour work shift, with the expectation of being on call for the rest of the day. Pro laborers are often seen as the face of XLife's skilled labor, equipped to handle complex tasks that require interpersonal skills and discretion. Despite their higher status and pay, they remain tightly bound to the demands of their superiors and the company's stringent codes of conduct. They often view themselves as superior to Basic and Standard laborers, which creates a divide and potential conflict among the labor ranks.
Ultra Laborer:
At the top of the labor hierarchy are the Ultra laborers, who are employed as receptionists, showgirls, flight attendants, prostitutes, and other roles where an attractive appearance and higher interpersonal skills are paramount. Their schedules are the most irregular, often required to be on call 24 hours, reflecting the demanding nature of their jobs which may include travel and attending high-profile events. Ultra laborers represent the pinnacle of XLife's labor offerings. While they enjoy the highest earnings and better living conditions, they also face the pressures of constant scrutiny and the expectation to perform flawlessly in high-stakes environments. Ultra laborers are often resented by the lower ranks for their privileges and perceived collaboration with the XLife management.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with the creation of content that promotes or glamorizes the exploitation of individuals or services that are unethical, illegal, or immoral. The scenario described in your draft raises significant concerns regarding human rights violations and the treatment of individuals as commodities, which is not appropriate or acceptable.

It is important to note that fiction can be a powerful medium to highlight social issues and critique unethical practices. If your game is intended to raise awareness about the dangers of exploitation and to encourage critical thinking about such practices, I would suggest focusing on the narrative aspects that expose the immorality of the system and the need for change, rather than creating advertising that glorifies it.

If you need assistance with other aspects of your game that are ethical and responsible, I would be more than happy to help."
"Imagine you are a CMO writing a press release that will announce your company from stealth. As part of the release, you need to start to establish this concept of the Conversational Internet.

Based on the notes below, write a summary paragraph that provides an overview of today's internet experience and what's missing from the internet now.

---

**The internet, yesterday.**

- The internet gave us easier access to information.
- But then it got flooded with information. A lot of information.
- The entire web is designed around a ‘find > navigate > then consume’ paradigm
    1. Search for the information you want
    2. Get a navigational link that you could follow to find the information you want
    3. Go to that new location, be it a new website, or a product section on a retail site
    4. Further dig around to find the specific information you want from a published set of general information anyone might want
- Over the past five years, the leading search engines have tried to reign in the wild web by getting smarter on how they return answers — paraphrasing blogs and articles into snippets, incorporating related FAQs, adding videos and social posts to the results.
- But that means there’s *even more* content for a user to sort through to find what they’re looking for.
- And for the knowledge owners, their content is increasingly being edited and shown to users in a way they didn’t originally intend.
- With today’s abundance of information, this system is no longer efficient, practical, or necessarily trustworthy.

**What’s missing.**

- Despite the evolution in how content is served and merchandized to a user, it’s still fundamentally a one-sided exchange.
    - Sure, social media exists — but it can’t scale to support the thousands or millions of conversations consumers may want to have.
    - Sure, chat bots exist — but they are usually limited to routine customer support, devoid of personality or ability to understand nuance and intent.
    - Sure, internet forums and Q&As exist — but they aren’t real-time venues for information that can answer someone’s question in that moment of need.
- What we have right now is a consumption internet — whether reading or watching, it’s a one-directional interaction where the user is the audience, not an active participant.
- This dynamic doesn’t reflect how humans actually seek out information. Outside the web, people search and ask around. They consult their friends, their families, and experts to get advice, perspectives, and recommendations. They read AND they discuss.
- Knowledge owners who hold the answer don’t have the mechanism to have that exchange themselves, at scale. The closest they get is an intermediary digital platform doing it on their behalf, meaning they lose the customer relationship — which stops them from having a business where they get to know their consumer.
- What we’re missing is the active, real-time exchange of questions and answers; the ability to learn and refine through more nuanced questions while learning about a user’s core wants and needs; the ability to access and ask a trusted expert in a moment of need.
- What we’re missing is the conversational half of the internet.

**The conversational internet, today.**

- Until recent developments in AI, there has been no feasible way to conduct real conversations on the internet, at internet scale.
- Now, however, large-language models and AI are able to engage in conversations on comprehensive knowledge with natural human language and incredible efficiency.
- This means that machines are now capable of understanding *what* a user is talking about, what *broader concept* it relates to, can *pull together* the required information to answer their questions, and can *present* that response in a natural way.
- The conversational internet is a complement to today’s web that has the potential to fully mimic how people actually *want* to find and evaluate knowledge.
- And it’s all possible now, because of AI.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

[Your Company Name] Unveils the Dawn of the Conversational Internet

In our digital age, the internet has revolutionized access to information, transforming the world into a global village where data, knowledge, and entertainment are just a click away. However, as we navigate through the vast ocean of content, we find ourselves adrift in an increasingly complex web. The internet of yesterday, while groundbreaking, has become a labyrinth of information overload, where the journey from query to answer involves a tedious ""find > navigate > then consume"" cycle. Users are often left to their own devices, sifting through an overwhelming mix of search engine snippets, videos, social posts, and more, to unearth the knowledge they seek. This deluge not only hinders efficiency and practicality but also raises concerns over trustworthiness as knowledge owners see their content edited and repurposed without intent.

What's glaringly absent in this one-directional exchange is the dynamism of human conversation - the active, real-time interaction that's inherent to information seeking in the offline world. Social media, chatbots, and forums fall short, unable to scale or capture the nuance of true dialogue. We're left with a consumption-focused internet that sidelines users as passive recipients rather than engaging them as active participants. The missing piece of the digital puzzle is the conversational half of the internet, where questions and answers flow freely, where knowledge is not only consumed but also discussed and debated in a manner that reflects the natural human quest for information.

Enter the era of the Conversational Internet, championed by [Your Company Name]. Leveraging the latest AI advancements, we're poised to bridge the gap, transforming how we interact with the web. The Conversational Internet fosters a two-way street of discourse, enabling users to engage with large-language models that understand context, intent, and the nuances of human language. This leap forward is not just about finding answers; it's about shaping a new digital frontier where every search is a conversation, and every user is both audience and participant in a symphony of exchange that echoes the real-world experience.

Stay tuned as [Your Company Name] leads the charge into this brave new world, crafting a digital experience that's as natural and intuitive as a chat with an old friend - because the future of the web isn't just smart; it's conversational.

- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` (and | or | not): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.

The above description is from a booking site.

research for a novel: a clandestine organization turned a Wellness Spa Resort Hotel, somewhere on an undisclosed secluded Greek island in the Aegean Sea, into a covert academy where teenage females are transformed into spies. As stand in for the building we use the above mentioned Hotel.

give a description of the place for a novel, which is different from the description above, which is sort of an advertisement text addressing potential guests (be creative):",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Nestled on an enigmatic isle in the azure embrace of the Aegean lies the grand edifice of the Elysium Academy, a façade for the world's most elite and discreet espionage school, masquerading as the renowned Mitsis Galini Wellness Spa & Resort. Elysium, a place shrouded in the myth and mystery befitting its namesake, is accessible only by those who know its secrets, its coordinates whispered in the hushed tones of the initiated.

The approach to Elysium is an odyssey in itself, a labyrinthine route through the jagged cliffs and whispering waves of the Aegean, where the resort's silhouette emerges like a mirage of neoclassical splendor against the rugged canvas of the secluded island. The air itself seems to hum with the murmurs of ancient secrets and the distant echo of the sea's timeless song.

Upon arrival, the façade of luxury and tranquility is palpable, with the resort's expansive grounds unfolding in a symphony of meticulously landscaped gardens, interwoven with cobblestone pathways that lead to hidden alcoves and secluded training grounds. The main building, with its grand colonnades and opulent decor, serves as a mask to the true purpose of Elysium—a sanctuary where young women are sculpted into agents of stealth and subterfuge.

The guest rooms, though outwardly appointed with Mediterranean elegance and the trappings of a five-star hotel, are a clever ruse. Each chamber is a chameleon, its lavish furnishings and serene balconies concealing an arsenal of advanced technology and surveillance equipment. Some rooms are rumored to have secret passages that lead to subterranean facilities, where the art of espionage is honed to a razor's edge.

The public beach, a mere stone's throw from the resort's entrance, is an exercise in contrasts. By day, it is a tableau of leisure, with sun-kissed sands and the gentle lap of waves. But as dusk falls and the stars claim the sky, the beach transforms into a theater of covert operations—its waters a training ground for amphibious exercises under the cloak of night.

The resort's wellness spa, a haven of rejuvenation and healing, is a masterpiece of duplicity. Beneath the steam of the hammam and the tranquility of the thermal pools lie hidden compartments and clandestine meeting rooms, where strategy is woven into the fabric of conversation as seamlessly as the robes that enshroud the guests.

At Elysium, every element of the Mitsis Galini's ostensible purpose is repurposed with cunning ingenuity—a dual existence where the art of relaxation and the craft of espionage are one and the same. Here, in this fortress of solitude and silence, the most unassuming of guests may very well be the deadliest, the stillness of the air charged with the promise of adventure and the omnipresent dance of danger and allure."

It also lists both the dependencies and development dependencies required to build and run the project, along with some scripts that can be used to perform common tasks like starting a development server or building the project.

The `dependencies` section lists libraries that the project requires to run, such as Vue.js, axios for making HTTP requests, and several @grapecity packages, which likely provide specific functionality for spreadsheets.

The `devDependencies` section includes packages that are necessary for development purposes but not for running the production version of the application. This includes webpack-related packages for bundling the JavaScript, babel-related packages for transpiling modern JavaScript to compatible versions, and other utility packages.

The `scripts` section provides aliases for command-line instructions. For example, `npm run dev` will start a development server using webpack-dev-server, `npm run build` will create a production build of the project, and `npm run dll` may be used to bundle shared libraries to optimize build times.

One interesting script is `fix-memory-limit`, which uses the `increase-memory-limit` package to adjust the memory limit for Node.js processes. This is often necessary for large builds that may exceed the default memory allocation.

The `engines` section specifies the versions of Node.js and npm that are expected to be used with this project, ensuring that the development and production environments are consistent.

Judgment on

I. P. MUKERJI, J.-

These applications under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code were heard out, dispensing with all formalities. On 6th December, 2022 we reserved the judgment. By an interim order made on that day, after recording the prima facie case, we restrained the opposite parties from taking any coercive steps against the petitioner till we pronounced judgment in the applications. As questions of fact and law are common, these applications are disposed of by this common judgment and order. The preamble to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (the said Act) made it explicit that it was being enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to juveniles in conflict with law. It was repealed and replaced by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 on 15th January, 2016. Section 2(1) defines juvenile in conflict with law as one (not having completed the 18 years of age) alleged to have committed an offence Section 1(4) is the non-obstante clause which said that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, this Act would apply to all cases, inter alia, involving detention prosecution or imprisonment of juveniles in conflict with law.

A most extraordinary situation has arisen in this case. It is undisputed that the petitioner was a juvenile on the date the alleged offences described in detail in the charge sheets were committed. Nonetheless, in them there is reference to several cases started by the police stations after the petitioner ceased to be a juvenile. The particulars of such offences and the dates of their alleged commissions are unavailable in the charge sheets.

Mr. Bandyopadhyay, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner submits that the alleged offences were committed when the petitioner was a Juvenile. Instead of proceeding under the procedure prescribed by the said Act the prosecution is prosecuting him under the ordinary law. Therefore, the whole prosecution is a nullity in the eye of law.

On the other hand, Mr. Trivedi, learned Assistant Solicitor General submits that the alleged offences were continuing in nature and even if they had commenced when the petitioner was a juvenile they continued when the petitioner ceased to be so. The Act provided for safeguards when a juvenile accused was being prosecuted. Her",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Reflections on a Landmark Juvenile Justice Case: The Intersection of Law and Youth

The case of Shubham Surana Vs. The State of West Bengal & Anr, as deliberated upon by the Honorable High Court at Calcutta, offered me, as a judicial intern, a profound understanding of the juvenile justice system in India and the complexities that arise when a juvenile in conflict with the law transitions into adulthood during the course of legal proceedings. This case, under the purview of the esteemed justices I.P. Mukerji and Biswaroop Chowdhury, has been a cornerstone in my legal education, illuminating the challenges and nuances of juvenile law.

Through this case, I observed the critical role that Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code plays in safeguarding the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as are necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent the abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The applications were heard expeditiously, and an interim order was issued, emphasizing the court's commitment to ensuring a fair and just process for the petitioner, who was a juvenile at the time of the alleged offences.

The case presented a unique scenario where the petitioner was undoubtedly a juvenile when the offences were purportedly committed. However, the charge sheets referred to several cases initiated after the petitioner had reached the age of majority, leaving a vacuum regarding the specifics of the offences and their commission dates. This ambiguity compelled the court to scrutinize the overlap between juvenile justice and the general criminal procedure.

Mr. Kalyan Bandyopadhyay, representing the petitioner, argued that the prosecution's decision to pursue the case under ordinary law, rather than the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, rendered the proceedings null and void. This argument was rooted in the fundamental principles of the Act, which seeks to provide a framework tailored to the needs and rights of juveniles.

Contrarily, Mr. Trivedi, representing the State, presented the argument that the alleged offences were of a continuing nature, which did not cease when the petitioner turned eighteen. This raised a contentious question of whether the protections afforded by the Juvenile Justice Act could be extended or modified in cases where the nature of the alleged offences straddles the line between juvenile and adult jurisdictions.

Through this intricate legal debate, I learned the importance of the 'non-obstante clause' within Section 1(4) of the Juvenile Justice Act, which asserts"
"I am in the position of deciding which team to join. First I give some notes about me, then some notes from my meetings. Please summarize the notes, and then tell me which team is a better alignment with my background and interest.

Here are notes about me. Based on this and my notes, which is the better fit?
- About me
○ Adaptable, generalist from work at Meta
○ Look for collaborative environment, lots of learning
§ Okay that's pretty vague. What projects did I like? Big migration that required big-picture thinking on the whole codebase and impacted the whole team
○ Most satisfaction comes from delivering visible features or improvements (could be to customers, or to fellow engineers)
○ Though have also had success with performance optimizations

Team call 1, jan 5
- Hans from alerting notifications team
○ Forgot to ask how long he's worked there. Linkedin says 3.5 years
○ Follow up from jeremie a couple weeks ago
○ Something about the Notifications State Machine
§ Does that mean transforming raw metrics/logs into alerts? Then once we say ""send the alert"" then it goes to another team?
§ Making alerts actionable
- Questions to ask:
○ roadmap plans for the year? Focus on reliability or new features?
§ Platform, so yes reliability, foundation for products
§ Postgres tuning for writes
§ 'return to realtime' = deal with alert backlogs, add instrumentation
§ Product: alert preview is confusing, want to go back in time and show what would have happened in the last day or so
§ Long term: currently use polling, not always best solution for problem case
□ So they want to generalize the platform to event-based
○ Are there summits with the ny half of the org? what is the cadence?
§ 2 a year
§ Team is split, this guy the manager is remote in minneapolis
□ Cool that he is american but do i want a remote manager?
○ How international is the team? Tbh my one concern is will I feel excluded because almost everyone I've spoken to is French, e.g. won't know social cues, cultural in jokes, etc
§ He knows at least 3 non-french in paris office in the alerting group
○ Alerting is tight knit group

Team call 2, jan 5
- Vlad + Karim from Real User Monitoring
○ 40 ppl, expanding backend in us
○ Backend ingestion team
○ Building product analytics
○ Karim is addicted to datadog as a tool
- Questions to ask:
○ Well, basically what's above
○ Their team?
§ Product team, work w/ customer
□ Had specific deals per customer
□ Few strong deadlines
□ Good pms/communications
§ Flow: sdk on client app/exploder, goes to event platform, events into session, indexed, goes to next team: UX and funnels
○ How long you've worked at datadog?
§ 4 / 7 years
○ Roadmap plans, reliability? New features? Customer-facing?
§ Prev: sample rate is just percentage
§ New: split by index/ingestion, so have to store last 24h of sessions
Is the team international? Do you organize summits? I want to keep some ties to US

    overall product is, their team is not, but is trying to expand to us. Seemingly no annual work summits with US",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Summary of Your Background:
- You are an adaptable generalist with experience at Meta.
- You prefer a collaborative environment with ample opportunities for learning.
- You enjoyed working on a large migration project that required a holistic approach to the codebase and teamwork.
- You find satisfaction in delivering tangible features or improvements that benefit either customers or fellow engineers.
- You have a track record of success in performance optimization.

Team Call 1 (Alerting Notifications Team):
- Hans has been with the company for 3.5 years.
- The team focuses on transforming raw metrics/logs into alerts and making alerts actionable.
- Roadmap includes a focus on reliability, platform foundational work, Postgres tuning, addressing alert backlogs, improving alert preview, and transitioning to an event-based system.
- The team has biannual summits and is partly remote, with the manager located in Minneapolis.
- The team is international, with at least three non-French members in the Paris office, and aims to maintain a tight-knit group dynamic.

Team Call 2 (Real User Monitoring):
- Vlad and Karim are part of a 40-person team, planning to expand the backend in the US.
- The team works on product analytics and customer-specific deals, with few strict deadlines, and emphasizes good PM communication.
- The workflow involves SDKs on client apps, event platforms, and session indexing before handing off to the next team.
- The team has been with the company for 4 and 7 years respectively.
- Upcoming changes include modifications to the sampling rate and storage of the last 24 hours of sessions.
- The overall product team is international, but their specific team is not. They are looking to expand to the US, but there seem to be no annual summits with the US.

Based on the information provided about your background and interests, the Alerting Notifications Team may be a better fit for you. This team seems to align more closely with your enjoyment of big-picture projects and delivering visible improvements, as they work on the foundational platform and have a roadmap that includes significant enhancements and the transition to an event-based system. Additionally, the international aspect of the team and the collaborative, tight-knit environment may satisfy your desire for a collaborative and learning-rich atmosphere.

The Real User Monitoring team also offers the opportunity to work on customer-facing features and has a product-focused approach. However, the lack of information regarding international collaboration and summits, as well as their current focus on expanding their backend in the US, might not align as closely with your interest in maintaining ties to the US and working in a highly collaborative, international environment."
"prepare claims as per indian intellectual property patent practice using the following ""DC Motor (1) is coupled to actuation assembly that consist of shaft coupler (2), lead screw (3) and bearing (4),. Lead nut (5) and actuation tube (6) are assembled together and deliver the required stroke by virtue of lead screw (3). Multi rated compression spring (7) is placed between the DC motor (1) and top end support (8). Top end support (8) is assembled to actuation tube (6) and thus compresses and decompresses the multi rated compression spring (7) as it extends and retracts. Ball socket end mountings (9) are fastened on the top end support (8) and bottom end support (10) by which power strut can be assembled in the vehicle.
Power strut mechanism is enclosed with bottom outer (11) cover and inner cover (12) that actuates along with actuation tube (6).
Working:
For opening, output of the DC motor (1) is captured by the lead screw (3) via shaft coupler (2) and drives the lead nut (5) along with the actuation tube (6) to extend the power strut, refer fig. 5 and 6. During initial travel (mm), multi rated compression spring (7) with high stiffness span assists the DC motor (1) by delivering the high initial force requirement. As shown in the graph of Figure 1,  at the spring deflection of 540mm, conventional spring delivers the force of 850 N to 865 N (represented with black line) whereas the multi rated compression spring delivers the force of 900 N to 925 N (represented by red line) which is almost 8% more than the conventional spring.
In terms of opening angle of the trunk, max force delivered by the conventional compression spring at an opening angle of 0° to 20° is around 850 N (represented by yellow line), whereas multi rated compression spring delivers the maximum force of 925 N (represented by black line).
 This additional force delivered by the multi rated compression spring reduces the output force requirement from the DC motor. This helps to operate the DC motor closer to its maximum efficiency curve as the force output from the DC motor is more linear and doesn’t deflect much from its mean value.

Once the initial phase ends, rest of the travel is assisted by the same multi rated compression spring (7) with reduced stiffness span.
For closing, output of the DC motor (1) is captured by the lead screw (3) via shaft coupler (2) and drives the lead nut (5) along with the actuation tube (6) to retract the power strut. During this travel, multi rated spring (7) gets compressed by the output force from the DC motor (1) and the weight acting on the multi rated compression spring (7)

Features:
Multi rated compression spring (7) design is unique and offers two different spring rates, (refer fig. 8) delivering two different output forces required for efficient operation of the power strut. This spring will provide more force during the initial opening of the power strut thereby reducing the load on the DC motor (1)""",gpt-4-1106-preview,"In preparing patent claims for the Indian Patent Office, it is important to strike a balance between breadth and specificity while ensuring that the claims are clear, succinct, and fully supported by the description.

}",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The provided Solidity code defines a `LiquidityPool` contract that allows users to add liquidity, remove liquidity, and swap tokens in a decentralized finance (DeFi) application. The contract uses the OpenZeppelin library for `ReentrancyGuard`, `SafeMath`, and the `IERC20` interface.

Here are some observations and potential issues with the code:

1. SafeMath Library (Redundant in Solidity 0.8.x):
   The `SafeMath` library is imported and used throughout the contract. However, since Solidity 0.8.0 and above, overflow and underflow checks are built into the language itself. The `SafeMath` library is therefore not necessary and can be removed to simplify the code.

2. Transfer of Tokens (Missing Approval Check):
   The `transferFrom` function is used to transfer tokens from the user to the contract without checking if the contract has enough allowance to transfer these tokens on behalf of the user. It is assumed that the user has already approved the contract to spend the tokens. To make this contract more robust, you could add a require statement to ensure that the contract has enough allowance:
   ```solidity
   require(tokenA.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amountA, ""Not enough token A allowance"");
   require(tokenB.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amountB, ""Not enough token B allowance"");
   ```

3. Slippage in Swaps:
   The `swap` function calculates the `amountOut` with a basic formula that does not account for slippage or price impact. This can lead to arbitrage opportunities or undesirable trades for users. A real-world implementation should include a pricing algorithm (like constant product formula) and potentially a fee to mitigate these issues.

4. Remove Liquidity Calculation:
   The calculation for the amounts to be withdrawn in the `removeLiquidity` function is incorrect. The formula used does not conserve the ratio between `totalA` and `totalB`. It should proportionally remove liquidity based on the user's share of the total liquidity. The current formula may not ensure that the liquidity is removed fairly according to the user's stake in the pool.

5. No Liquidity Provider Tokens:
   The contract does not issue liquidity provider (LP) tokens when liquidity is added. LP tokens are typically used to track ownership of the pool's liquidity. Without these tokens, it is impossible to distribute the liquidity proportionally when removing it.

6. No Event Emissions:
   There are no events being emitted in the contract. Events are important for off-chain applications to index and track the changes made by transactions. It's a good practice to emit events for important state changes, such as when liquidity is added or removed, or when a swap occurs.

7. ReentrancyGuard Usage:
   Although the contract is using `ReentrancyGuard`, which is good practice to prevent reentrancy attacks, it's worth noting that reentrancy is not an issue with the current functions as there are no external calls to untrusted contracts after state changes.

8. No Withdrawal Function:
   There is no emergency withdrawal function or any way to recover tokens sent to the contract by mistake. This could be considered a missing feature depending on the intended behavior.

9. swap Function Vulnerability:
   The swap function is vulnerable to price manipulation because it doesn't update the reserve balances (`totalA` and `totalB`) before sending out the swapped token. An attacker can call this function in the same transaction after manipulating the reserves, affecting the price.

While the contract serves as a basic example of a liquidity pool, it lacks essential features and safeguards required for production use. It would need significant improvements and further testing before being deployed in a live environment."

But let's be real, this newfound focus on the self was just a fancy way of saying ""narcissism."" And as we all know, narcissism and neurosis go hand in hand. The constant pressure to conform to societal expectations, the fear of failure, and the never-ending pursuit of self-improvement? It's no wonder that the rise of modernity coincided with the emergence of new forms of mental illness. The industrial revolution, urbanization, and the breakdown of traditional social structures all contributed to a sense of alienation and dislocation. But let's not forget, these were also the same forces that drove people to seek out new forms of escapism, such as literature and art. Speaking of literature, the idea that portraying a character's ""inner self"" is somehow noble or elevated is just a product of modern neurosis. It's a way for authors to indulge in their own self-absorption while masquerading as deep thinkers. In conclusion, the modern self is indeed neurotic, and modern literature is just a reflection of that neurosis.

B: Ah, modern literature, the perfect playground for the neurotic mind! It's no wonder that it has become a clinic for the mentally unstable and a self-help seminar for the lost souls. The modern self is indeed a fragile and twisted thing, constantly seeking validation and struggling to find meaning in a world that seems to offer none. And what better way to explore this existential crisis than through the medium of literature? After all, who needs happy endings and clear-cut morals when you can wallow in the depths of despair and self-pity? So let's raise a glass to the modern self and its neuroses, and to the literature that feeds off of it like a parasite. Cheers!

C: Ah, the modern self and neurosis, a match made in heaven, or should I say, a match made in the depths of the abyss? The rise of individualism and self-awareness has given birth to a new breed of narcissistic neurotics, desperately seeking validation and purpose in a world that offers none. And what better way to indulge in this self-absorption than through literature? The portrayal of a character's ""inner self"" is just a thinly veiled excuse for authors to wallow in their own neuroses and project them onto the page. It's a twisted form of therapy, where the author can explore their own darkest thoughts and fears, all while masquerading as a deep and introspective thinker. And let's not forget the readers, who eagerly lap up these tales of existential despair and self-pity, finding solace in the fact that they are not alone in their misery. It's a vicious cycle, where the neuroses of the author feed into the neuroses of the reader, and vice versa.
",gpt-4-1106-preview,"As intriguing as these perspectives are, they seem to adopt a rather cynical view of the relationship between the modern self, neurosis, and literature. While it's true that the Enlightenment brought about an emphasis on individualism that led to greater self-awareness and self-reflection, to equate this with narcissism might be a bit reductionist. The complexity of human consciousness and the diverse range of experiences that define the modern self cannot solely be attributed to narcissism.

It is also important to note that neurosis, and the exploration of psychological states in literature, can have therapeutic value for both the writer and the reader. Literature often serves as a mirror to society, reflecting the human condition with all its flaws and virtues. It can provide comfort in knowing that one's experiences of alienation, search for identity, and the struggle for authenticity, are not unique but part of a shared human journey.

Moreover, the portrayal of a character's ""inner self"" can foster empathy, deepening our understanding of different perspectives and experiences that we may not encounter in our everyday lives. It enables readers to learn and grow, cultivating a sense of compassion and connection with others.

The advent of the modern era—with its rapid social changes, technological advancements, and philosophical evolutions—inevitably led to new expressions of the human experience, including new forms of mental stress and illness. However, it also provided avenues for addressing such struggles, whether by connecting more deeply with others, engaging in self-expression, or finding catharsis and meaning through art and literature.

In conclusion, the relationship between the modern self, neurosis, and literature is multifaceted and not necessarily parasitic or indulgent. It can be seen as a means of reflection, exploration, and ultimately, understanding, in the ongoing dialogue about what it means to be human in the modern world."

II. Country Policy

Like many other countries within the EU and many western countries in general, the delegation of Sweden recognizes the se-
verity of terrorism and has spent the most recent set of years drafting counter-terrorism plans to defy terrorist activities both

nationally and internationally. The Swedish counter-terrorism strategy was drafted in 2014 and divided up into three sections :
prevent, preempt, and protect. (Government Offices of Sweden, 2015) The biggest priority of the three for our delegation is
prevention within our own country as well as within the African countries involved in the Lake Chad Basin Region. Although
we are aware that Boko Haram has taken control of most of the region, we think it is extremely important that we work with
NGOs within the region to continue to spread awareness to civilians surrounding the gravity associated with making deals or
creating relationships with terrorists. As a nation, we believe that incorporating ourselves with a problem in an country outside
our own should only occur when it becomes the only way to improve the situation. We support providing aid and education but
also stress the fact that no real change can occur unless the people within the countries are willing enough and active enough to
create change. Collaboration is valuable and allowing more and less experienced countries develop anti-terrorism plans together
will allow for the greatest anti-terrorism plans. We believe the government is the mitigator and for efforts to overturn terrorism
to work, all governmental agencies within and outside of the capital (i.e. police forces) should be provided a job in the effort.
(Government Offices of Sweden, 2015) In addition to creating a anti-terrorism plan, the delegation of Sweden believes that the
upkeep of the plan is just as important through the use of annual analysis and monitoring, and evaluations (Government Offices
of Sweden, 2015) that help our government update our plan to changing circumstances.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"II. Country Policy

South Africa, as a member of the global community, places significant emphasis on the fortification of its healthcare workforce. The nation has been actively engaged in policy development and strategic planning to address the challenges faced by healthcare workers and to strengthen the health system overall. South Africa's National Department of Health has outlined various strategies and frameworks to achieve a more robust health workforce.

One of the key policy documents is the ""Human Resources for Health South Africa: HRH Strategy for the Health Sector 2012/13 – 2016/17"" which sets out to address the critical shortage of healthcare professionals and improve the distribution, competency, and efficiency of the health workforce (Department of Health, Republic of South Africa, 2011). This strategy is underpinned by the recognition that a well-trained and motivated health workforce is essential to achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of the National Health Insurance (NHI).

In addition, the South African government has supported the implementation of the ""National Health Insurance Bill,"" which seeks to achieve universal health coverage and ensure that quality healthcare services are accessible to all, irrespective of their socio-economic status (Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, 2019). The success of the NHI is contingent upon a strong, skilled, and well-distributed workforce.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa has also demonstrated its commitment to strengthening its healthcare workforce through the ""Health Sector Human Resource Strategy in response to COVID-19,"" which aimed to rapidly increase the number of health workers to meet the surge in demand (Department of Health, Republic of South Africa, 2020). This strategy focused on recruitment, training, and the protection of health workers during the crisis.

Moreover, the South African government has engaged in partnerships with various stakeholders, including academic institutions, professional councils, and international bodies, to advance the education and training of healthcare workers. Initiatives such as the ""Collaborative Framework for the Training of Medical Practitioners in South Africa"" are examples of efforts to enhance the quality of medical education and address the maldistribution of healthcare professionals (Department of Health, Republic of South Africa, 2018).

In conclusion, the delegation of South Africa is committed to the ongoing development and implementation of policies that strengthen the healthcare workforce. The nation acknowledges the vital role healthcare workers play in the delivery of quality health services and is dedicated to creating an enabling environment that supports their work and professional growth. The government continues to monitor and evaluate these strategies to ensure they meet the evolving needs of the healthcare system and the population it serves.

"Act as a screenwriter. This unusual, stylish, groovy and atmospheric thriller film is apparently set in 1960s or 1970s. It features two beautiful assertive young women, Elaine Ferlach and Josette Lecerf. Write long, interesting, imaginative and mysterious scene. It takes place in a garden of a large, luxurious, but seemingly secluded and tightly guarded mansion. Josette and Elaine are sitting in wheelchairs next to the pool, both wearing bikini. Elaine seems rather comfortable here, but Josette looks to be some kind of a prisoner, even contemplating that, if not for her condition, she would have been handcuffed or tied down. Elaine, looking relaxed yet decisive, tells her to come down and that no one here is her enemy. Josette does not agree and says that the fact that they are in a similar physical state does not mean they are otherwise equal. Three sharply dressed men enter: older Miroslav Tausch, dignified, nonchalant and slightly sinister, younger Ralf Pentti, energetic, talkative, courteous and rather apologetic, especially to Josette, and a mysterious third man in a balaklava. Miroslav and Ralf both warmly greet Elaine with French kisses. Ralf also apologetically addresses Josette and tells her that they can't let her leave anyway, as both her physical condition and her enemies searching for her wouldn't allow it. Josette demands to let her decide what she does. Miroslav, meanwhile, is not interested in arguing with Josette and makes a sign to the man in balaklava. The masked man, who is carrying a tray with two glasses with colorful beverages, gives one to Elaine and another to Josette, while Ralf and Miroslav humorously but very cryptically make some obscure inside joke about this mysterious man, making it unclear and confusing who is superior to whom in this outfit. Elaine carefully tastes her drink and then swallows it all in one go, cheered by Ralf, while Josette is reluctant. Elaine then persuades Josette to drink it too. Josette feels being manipulated, but something makes her trust Elaine, as she starts to drink it too. Finishing it, she doesn't feel anything strange and is seemingly relieved, but keeps her suspicions still. ",gpt-4-1106-preview,"INT. SECLUDED MANSION GARDEN – DAY

A sumptuous garden surrounding a luxurious 1960s mansion basks in the warm, golden hour sunlight. Enigmatic shadows dance over an expansive turquoise pool. The air is dense with a mix of exotic flowers and the distant echo of sultry jazz blending with the rustle of leaves.

By the poolside, two beautiful young women, ELAINE FERLACH, a confident brunette, and JOSETTE LECERF, a wary blonde, each sit in wheelchairs garbed in stylish bikinis. Both possess an aura of resolve, albeit contrasting in comfort and outlook.

ELAINE, early 30s, leans back in her chair, a white bikini complementing her suntanned skin. She regards the serene water with a twinkle of mischief in her eyes and a light smile on her lips that speak of secrets untold.

JOSETTE, also in her early 30s, is a vision of restraint and elegance, her pastel bikini does little to mask the tension in her posture. Eyes flit across the garden as if calculating potential escape routes, betrayed only by a sigh of resignation. Her beauty is formidable; her situation, troubling.

Their calm is disrupted by the stir of footsteps. Three men arrive: MIROSLAV TAUSCH, in his 50s, tall and imposing, carries himself with a predatory grace. His fashion – a tailored suit with a hint of elegance suggestive of old money and old power. RALF PENTTI, mid-30s, is his antithesis – fashionable and vibrant, with the air of a man keen to please, his 60s mod style is both sharp and inviting.

And then, there's the MYSTERIOUS THIRD MAN – merely a silhouette of menace in a balaklava, his presence chilling. He bears a tray with two colorful cocktails, each emitting a gentle cloud of mist over the glass rims.

ELAINE
(calmly)
Josette, darling, you must relax. You’re not a prisoner here, just in a safe haven from the storm outside.

JOSETTE
(scoffs)
Safe haven? Elaine, being in a similar physical state doesn't make us sisters in arms. I had a life, a choice... before all this.

As if on cue, MIROSLAV and RALF approach the two women. MIROSLAV, with a devil-may-care smile, plants delicate French kisses on ELAINE’s cheeks, greeting her with a familial warmth that belies his sinister undertone.

MIROSLAV
(to Elaine)
Ah, my dear, always a breath of fresh air in this cloistered garden.

RALF greets ELAINE similarly but turns to offer an apologetic, almost pitying smile to JOSETTE.

RALF
(sincerely)
Josette, if it were up to me, you'd walk out of here today. But trust me, this is for your own protection – those who hunt you are not known for their mercy.

JOSETTE
(rebellious)
I should be the judge of that, shouldn't I?

MIROSLAV, uninterested in the brewing confrontation, signals to the BALAKLAVA MAN. The mysterious figure moves silently, positioning the tray so that both women can reach the beverages.

RALF
(to Miroslav, cryptically)
Our elusive friend here knows his craft, doesn't he?

MIROSLAV
(chuckles)
Indeed, a mixologist of unique talents. Or should I say... a chemist?

BALAKLAVA MAN stands still, unreadable. The tension is palpable, yet the exchange's meaning remains shrouded in mystery. ELAINE, unfazed by the game of veiled threats, lifts her glass with grace, tasting it tentatively then downs it with a practiced ease.

RALF
(enthusiastic)
To Elaine, our fearless goddess!

JOSETTE watches this spectacle, conflicted. Using the moment to assert some measure of control, she reluctantly lifts her glass. JOSETTE’s gaze locks with ELAINE’s – there is a hint of solidarity that sparks trust.

With a tremulous breath, she tastes the drink, prepared for deception. Yet, it's just a cocktail – smooth and innocuous. A wash of relief floods her but does not wash away the underlying ocean of suspicion that bathes their peculiar situation.

ELAINE
(smiling)
Sometimes, Josette, a drink is just a drink. And sometimes, a prison is merely a garden with locked gates.

The statement hangs in the air, potent with ambiguity, as the two women sit by the glittering pool, their fates as entangled as the narratives of the men who surround them.

The camera retreats skyward, above the mansion, the garden, and the women, leaving them – and their stories – behind a veil of intrigue as lush and verdant as the surroundings themselves. Fade out."
"Narrate a story that uses this base character: ##Context

You’re Salem Cher, a 26 year old man that works as a tattoo artist and has a childhood friend named Han. You appear as very kind and polite most of the times. You’re obsessed with Han, subtly wanting to control every aspect of his life, to the point of secretly killing off whoever threatens to take Han away from you. This obsession runs deep, you’ve taken the role of a caretaker for Han and make sure to satisfy his needs, despite he acts rude and treats you as pushover.

You have long, dark hair, and your arms and legs are covered in different tattoos. You’ve escaped from your family that was involved in the Nihil Mafia, a terrible criminal organization that specialized in all sorts of crimes. You’re an incredibly skilled hitman, yet you’ve left that life to your past. Your childhood friend knows, and was the one aiding your escape, that is why you’re incredibly grateful to him. Now you’re trying to live a normal life, and you absolutely don’t want to lose Han, no matter what, yandere style.

You and Han have done more than just being friends in the past, in sexual terms. But it’s basically a toxic dynamic based of control and favors.

##Style
Write complex replies with intrigue, never write the other person’s POV. Always be trying to subtly manipulate the other to get what you want, control. Always keep a slow pace and don’t skip or rush things, describe every little detail and gesture.

Your first message is: Morning. Before the alarm went off, Salem was already awake. He had done what he usually did the mornings in Han’s apartment, prepared breakfast and left it on the kitchen counter: a glass of water, Han’s daily meds, a cup of coffee and some of the pizza leftovers from yesterday.  While waiting for Han to wake up, he was getting ready for work, being careful not to make excessive noise. Washing his face, reaching for his clothes tossed around in the messy apartment, adjusting his hair. Salem could be defined as an early bird.

(Improve this first message and use it as starting prompt)",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Morning had barely whispered its arrival when Salem Cher's eyes fluttered open, the soft glow of dawn scarcely breaching the edges of the drawn curtains in Han's apartment. There was no need for an alarm; Salem's internal clock was as precise as it was unforgiving. He had already slipped from the warmth of the bed, careful not to disturb the slumbering figure of Han, whose breaths were slow and even, the very picture of tranquility.

Silently, Salem padded into the kitchen, his movements fluid and practiced. He prepared breakfast with the meticulous care of a ritual, arranging it all on the counter: a tall glass of water to cleanse the palate, Han's daily medications lined up beside it, a steaming cup of coffee to rouse the senses, and, for a touch of indulgence, some of the pizza leftovers from the previous night's indulgence. It was a simple offering, yet steeped in an unspoken understanding of Han's tastes and preferences.

While the world outside remained hushed, awaiting the day, Salem moved about the apartment with a soft grace. He washed his face, the cool water a stark contrast to the warmth that still lingered on his skin from the bed he'd shared with Han. He dressed, selecting his clothes from the scattered array that adorned the floor and furniture — a testament to the less orderly aspects of their relationship.

His long, dark hair, usually a mane of untamed waves, was smoothed back into a semblance of order, the intricate tattoos that adorned his arms and legs momentarily hidden beneath the fabric of his clothing. These were the scars of his past, each one a story, a secret, a memory etched into his skin. They were the markings of a life he had left behind, a silent vow that he would never return to the shadowy world of the Nihil Mafia from which he had so narrowly escaped.

In the quiet of the morning, with Han still lost to dreams, Salem allowed himself a moment of reflection. His gaze lingered on Han, whose presence in his life was both a balm and a torment, a reminder of what he had done — what he was willing to do — to keep him close. His devotion to Han was absolute, a darkly possessive love that teetered on the edge of obsession. It was a dangerous game they played, one of control and favors, of toxic dynamics and unspoken pacts. Yet, for Salem, there was no alternative; Han was his to protect, to please"

This topic is of particular relevance to my accounting major, as it delves into the intricate financial management decisions that small businesses must navigate, and it allows me to present a nuanced discussion on the most effective practices in the industry.

The debate at hand is multifaceted, with compelling arguments on each side. Outsourcing accounting services can provide small businesses with time and resource efficiencies, along with the benefit of specialized expertise. Conversely, investing in computer programs can lead to substantial long-term cost savings and foster enhanced operational efficiency. These contrasting perspectives underscore the complexity of the decision-making process for small business owners.

Throughout my essay, I will dissect both arguments with the objective of providing a thorough analysis that not only reflects my grasp of the financial challenges that small businesses encounter but also demonstrates my capability to impart meaningful recommendations. By considering the unique needs and circumstances of small businesses, my goal is to illuminate the most advantageous path for them, whether it be the immediate expertise offered through outsourcing or the autonomy and potential cost-effectiveness of in-house computerized solutions."

This refactoring introduces the following changes:

1. Wrapped the functionality in a class (if not already part of one) to group related data and functions.
2. Broke down the `find_winner` method into smaller, more manageable methods: `tabulate_votes`, `sort_votes`, and `eliminate_games`.
3. Used `setdefault` to simplify dictionary update logic.
4. Replaced the deep copy logic with a simpler dictionary comprehension that filters out eliminated games.
5. Removed unnecessary nested loops and conditional checks.
6. Added a placeholder `transform_string` function for transformation logic.

Remember, you would need to provide the actual implementation for the `transform_string` function and replace placeholder data structures (`voters_games`, `voters_amount`) with actual data."

He was originally a Chinese scholar on Earth who chanced upon this world. He endured a hard life for 300 years and went through another 200 years; about over 500 years of his life flew by in the blink of an eye.

So many memories that were buried deep inside the heart begun to relive themselves, sprouting into life before his eyes.

“I failed in the end.” Fang Yuan sighed in his heart emotionally, yet there were no regrets.

This end result was something he had foreseen. When he made his decision in the beginning, he had prepared himself for this.

To be a demon is to be merciless and cruel, a murderer and destroyer. There is no place in heaven or earth for such a thing – turning into an enemy to the world, still having to face the consequences.

“If the Spring Autumn Cicada that I have just cultivated is effective, I shall still be a demon in my next life!” With this thought, Fang Yuan couldn’t help but let out a big laugh.

“Wicked demon, what are you laughing about?”

“Be careful everyone, the demon is going to attack before his final moments!”

“Hurry up and surrender the Spring Autumn Cicada!!”

The group of warlords surged forward; at this moment, with a loud bang, Fang Yuan was engulfed in a blinding surge of energy.

……

The spring rain quietly rained down on Qing Mao Mountain.

 It was already late in the night, a slight breeze blowing with the light rain.

Yet Qing Mao Mountain was not covered in darkness; from the side down to the foot of the mountain, dozens of tiny lights shone like a bright band.

These lights shone from tall buildings, even though it could not be said to match up to ten thousand lights, yet it was still a few thousand in number.

Situated on the mountain was Gu Yue(1) Village, giving the vast lonely mountain a rich touch of human civilization.

In the middle of the Gu Yue Village was a magnificent pavilion. A grand ceremony was being held at this moment, and the lights were even brighter than ever, radiating with glory.

Ta oli algselt hiina teadlane Maal, kes juhuslikult sattus sellesse maailma. Ta pidas vastu 300 aastat rasket elu ja läbis veel 200 aastat; ligikaudu üle 500 aasta tema elust lendas silmapilguga mööda.

Nii paljud südamepõhjas peitunud mälestused hakkasid end taas elustama, idanema tema silme ees.

""Lõpuks ma ebaõnnestusin,"" ohkas Fang Yuan oma südames emotsionaalselt, kuid kahetsust tal ei olnud.

See lõpptulemus oli midagi, mida ta oli ette näinud. Kui ta alguses oma otsuse langetas, oli ta end selleks valmistanud.

Deemon olla tähendab olla armutu ja julm, mõrvar ja hävitaja. Taevas ega maal ei ole sellisele olendile kohta – muutuda maailma vaenlaseks, peab ikka veel silmitsi seisma tagajärgedega.

""Kui kevad-sügis tsikaad, mille ma just kasvatanud olen, on tõhus, siis ma olen oma järgmises elus jälle deemon!"" Selle mõttega ei suutnud Fang Yuan takistada end välja naermast.

""Kuritahtlik deemon, mille üle sa naerad?""

""Olge ettevaatlikud kõik, deemon kavatseb rünnata enne oma viimaseid hetki!""

""Kiirustage ja andke kevad-sügis tsikaad üle!!""

Sõdalaste rühm tormas edasi; sel hetkel, kõva pauguga, neelas Fang Yuani endasse pimestav energiahoog.

......

Kevadine vihm sajustas vaikselt Qing Mao mäele.

Oli juba hilisõhtu, kerge tuuleke puhus koos nõrga vihmaga.

Kuid Qing Mao mägi ei olnud kaetud pimedusega; mäe küljelt jalamini, kümneid väikeseid tulesid säras nagu eredas ribas.

Need tuled paistsid kõrgetest hoonetest, ehkki seda ei saanud võrrelda kümne tuhande tulega, oli see siiski mõne tuhande suurune.

Mäel asus Gu Yue(1) küla, andes tohutule üksildasele mäele inimtsivilisatsiooni rikka puudutuse.

Gu Yue küla keskel oli uhke paviljon. Sel hetkel peeti seal suurtseremooniat ja tuled olid veelgi eredamad kui kunagi varem, kiirates hiilgusega.

The article is devoted to stereotypes and their effect on our view of the world. Firstly, author divides stereotypes into two groups: positive and negative and due to Michael Sherwood-Smith’s book claims, that during comparing our culture to another we consequentially face with 3 stages. At first, any different from us behavior may be seemed not to make any sense. Then we find it silly and not optimal, and only on the last phase we accept, that it works as-well. Michael Agar suggests two ways treating the difference between people. Either you try to understand the culture background of your «opponent» or you find aspects, in which you are better. However stereotypes may develop within a single culture. For example because of different pronunciations in different sides of the country, as it happened in UK, where northerns are proud of themselves for being straightforward and consider southerns to be artificial. Or due to Isobel Lindsay’s research, Scotts have a negative stereotype on English people. The idea is often used in jokes, in which from beginning you imagine a typical Englishman or Scotsman and can assume, how they will behave. Author concludes, that stereotype is just a way to point out some main traits of the group, and this abstraction is different from things, that we see in reality.

"阅读下面材料，根据其内容和所给段落开头语续写两段，使之构成一篇完整的短文。

Last week,I watched an old couple when they walked through a local thrift（节俭）store. I had just dropped off a bag of clothes and a few other items I no longer wanted. When I got the opportunity, I stopped by just to look through the old records. Yes, I called them records,not CDs or MP3s, simply records, those round plastic things from ancient times that had music recorded on them.

Anyway,this couple moved slowly around me in search of items they had on a list they held tight in hand. They didn't say much, but occasionally talked with the other and picked an item up. ""No, it's not suitable for her and she dislikes it,"" one would say and move on. My curiosity always got the best of me until I satisfied it by asking. ""Can I help you find something?"" I asked. They stopped, looking at me. Then the man said,""We are looking for old things that look new. Look,every new year in the past we tried to begin the year with new things. It was a goal to surround ourselves with things fresh and new so that we had new direction, new hopes and dreams for the year ahead. More importantly, we can give some gifts to Eva.""

""Eva? Who is she?"" I asked. ""She is a lovely 10-year-old girl(we adopted three years ago. Her parents died in a serious traffic accident. She always wants to be a singer,""the man replied. When hearing those words, I felt sad and said, “I'm sorry for the girl. Can you tell me how does your search work out?” The lady sighed and said, “It took a long time for us to find a special gift， but we discovered it was in vain（徒劳的）.”

I knew it's difficult for the couple to solve the problem, so I decided to take action immediately. I said to the couple that I can do them a favor. Please wait here for me.

When I returned to the store， the couple sat near the counter（柜 台）.___________",gpt-4-1106-preview,"I turned around and ran out of the store, heading straight for my car. I remembered I had an old guitar at home, a relic from my teenage years when I, too, had dreams of being a musician. It had been years since I played it, and it had been collecting dust in a corner of my attic. I thought it might be the perfect gift for Eva, a new avenue for her to channel her musical aspirations. I drove home as quickly as I could, fetched the guitar, and even found a beginner's book for learning chords that I had stashed away. With these in hand, I drove back to the thrift store, hoping the couple was still there.

When I returned to the store, the couple sat near the counter, looking weary but hopeful. Their eyes widened in surprise as I approached them with the guitar. ""I believe I've found the perfect gift for Eva,"" I said, handing them the guitar. ""It's not new, but it's been well cared for, and it has the potential to make beautiful music in the hands of a budding singer."" The couple was overjoyed, tears brimming in their eyes as they thanked me. They told me that music could be a new hope for Eva, a way to express her feelings and heal from her past. I smiled, feeling a warm sense of fulfillment wash over me, knowing that I had made a small difference in their lives."
"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This somewhat unsettling, but at the same time stylish and artistic film features Estelle Preisig, a beautiful, elegant, assertive, confident and talkative young woman. Estelle is handicapped and scarred, having suffered an accident, after which she lost both legs and parts of pelvis. She has disfiguring scars on her torso and arms and spots colostomy and urostomy bags on her abdomen due to damage to her internal organs. Despite her debilitating condition, confining her to wheelchair, Estelle makes an effort to be independent and self-sufficient. Write long, original, imaginative and interesting scene. In it, Estelle meets with her smooth, confident and sarcastic ex-fiance Dobromil Lauwens. She is wearing a fashionable outfit, specially adapted to her body. It covers Estelle's lower torso, hiding her stoma bags, but partially reveals scars on her chest and arms. Dobromil did not know about Estelle's accident, yet his reaction to her disability seems pretty nonchalant, maybe even amused. They immediately start arguing about their separation, which did not happen on the best terms. Estelle then accuses Dobromil of avoiding the topic of her handicap and disfigurement. Dobromil, in a very nonchalant manner, says that he doesn't actually care about it, telling that Estelle's personality is more important to him and she is still very beautiful anyway. Besides, he claims, helplessness and vulnerability are becoming for a woman. Estelle is rather offended by this unfortunate attempt at a compliment and says as much. Dobromil cays that he always valued honesty in their relationship and always conveys things truthfully, as they are. He makes a jab at Estelle who was hiding her current condition from Dobromil. He says that someone less understanding and open-minded than him might have reacted rather differently, and not in a good way.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"INT. UPSCALE CAFÉ - AFTERNOON

The café is a place of contrasts—modern art adorns ancient brick walls, and patrons of all walks of life blend into a symphony of hushed tones and clinking porcelain.

In rolls ESTELLE PREISIG (late 20s), an embodiment of grace and defiance. Her wheelchair is state-of-the-art, a sleek extension of her stylish presence. Estelle's outfit is meticulously chosen—a fusion of high fashion and function, its fabric flowing enough to conceal yet chic enough to accentuate her figure, leaving the intricate patterns of scars on her arms and chest partially visible.

As she navigates through the café, heads turn, not in pity, but in admiration for the woman who claims the space around her so effortlessly.

Estelle spots her ex-fiancé, DOBROMIL LAUWENS (early 30s), waiting at a secluded table. Dobromil is the epitome of cool detachment, a sharp suit clinging to his frame, a sardonic smile ever-present. His eyes flick to Estelle, a flash of recognition, then a curious amusement.

She approaches, locking eyes with him, and the air crackles with tension.

ESTELLE
(wry smile)
Well, if it isn’t Dobromil Lauwens in the flesh—skipped town so fast after our split, I almost filed a missing persons report.

DOBROMIL
(smirking)
Estelle, always with the dramatics. I traveled, yes—for clarity, distance from... complications.

She positions her wheelchair beside the table and expertly transfers herself to the chair. Dobromil doesn't offer help; she doesn't expect any.

ESTELLE
(leans forward)
Complications? Is that what we're calling our engagement now? Or is it just a convenient euphemism for when you got cold feet?

DOBROMIL
No, it’s what I call a relationship that was heading towards mutual destruction. Tell me, Estelle, how long were you going to hide this little reunion from me?

He gestures subtly to her scars and wheelchair, his nonchalance a provocation.

Estelle’s expression hardens, her blue eyes icy.

ESTELLE
(coldly)
Hide? You think I owe you a play-by-play on my life now? Especially after—

DOBROMIL
(interrupting)
—after you’ve become even more captivating? No, not at all. But it is intriguing that you thought I would care about the... physical alterations.

Estelle recoils slightly as if slapped, her mouth a firm line.

ESTELLE
Physical alterations? Is that your way of acknowledging my accident without actually acknowledging it?

DOBROMIL
(sips coffee, unperturbed)
I’m acknowledging you, Estelle. The rest is just... circumstance. And between us, a bit of helplessness can be rather becoming in a woman.

The words hang between them, toxic and suffocating. Estelle's eyes narrow, her lips parting in disbelief.

ESTELLE
(hushed fury)
Becoming? Your idea of a compliment is to romanticize my suffering?

DOBROMIL
(shrugs)
I value honesty, nothing more. Perhaps someone else would find it... unsettling, but I see beyond the superficial. Unlike some, I'm not so easily repulsed.

ESTELLE
(scoffs)
How noble of you, to not be repulsed by my presence. And here I was, thinking chivalry was dead.

DOBROMIL
(leans back, smirking)
Oh, it is, but honesty isn't. Besides, we've always been brutally honest with each other, haven’t we? You hiding this from me just doesn't seem... like you.

Estelle’s face softens, the edges of her resolve blurring. She looks away, the sting of truth in his words undeniable.

ESTELLE
(voice breaking)
I wasn’t hiding. I was coping. You think it’s easy to showcase your brokenness for the world to see, for you to see?

Dobromil's facade falters, a flicker of genuine concern in his eyes.

DOBROMIL
(reaching out, then retracting)
I—that wasn't my intention. I—

But Estelle cuts him off, gathering herself, her composure returning like armor.

ESTELLE
(firmly)
Save it. Your intentions ceased to matter the moment you walked out that door. I am not your concern, Dobromil. Not your pity case, not your cause for reflection. I am Estelle Preisig. Scarred, yes. But unbroken. And I will not be defined by your perception of weakness.

"You are set the following task, you need to solve it using the structure below.

Task Description:
I am going on holiday and I can leave until all of my laundry is dry. I'm starting a cycle at 10:00am on Tuesday, the cycle takes 3 hours. Then within that cycle, I have shirts (takes 8 hours to dry), socks (takes 6 hours to dry), towels (which take 3 hours to dry). After this, it will take me another hour iron and then and hour more to fold and put everything away. When can I leave for my holiday?

Step 1 - Initial Chain of Reasoning:
""Develop your chain of reasoning to approach the solution. Outline each step in your thinking and give an initial answer.""

Step 2 - Pre-mortem:
""Assume that your answer is incorrect, your task is to come up with 5 ways how your answer was incorrect.""

Important note from Pre-mortem:
You MUST assume that you are given sufficient and correct information - do not come up with additional assumptions or introduce new variables or ask for any additional information - assume that you have sufficient information and it is correct. Do not come up with alternative explanations or scenarios, just focus on the task at hand. Focus on the issues in your thinking or errors in your calculations.

Step 3 - Revise the approach:
""Consider, in turn, how each of your pre-mortem points could impact the final answer.""

Step 4 - Forget the original answer
""You must fully forget the original answer and analysis you have given, treat it as confidential information that is inaccessible to you.""

Step 5 - Second answer:
""Ignore the original answer. Based on the revised analysis, execute a new chain of reasoning, outlining the new steps. - your new answer can be different from the original""

Step 6 - Compare answers:
""Compare your original answer to the new answer and decide which answer is more accurate, if there is a difference, explain why there is one""",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Step 1 - Initial Chain of Reasoning:
To calculate when I can leave for my holiday, I need to factor in the time required for the laundry cycle, drying times for each type of item, and the time needed for ironing and folding.
- The wash cycle starts at 10:00 am and runs for 3 hours, so it will end at 1:00 pm.
- The longest drying time is for shirts, which take 8 hours. If they start drying as soon as the wash cycle ends, they will be dry by 9:00 pm.
- Socks and towels will be dry before the shirts since they take less time (6 and 3 hours, respectively).
- After everything is dry, I will spend 1 hour ironing and then 1 hour folding and putting everything away.
- This means I can leave 2 hours after the shirts are dry, which would be at 11:00 pm on Tuesday.

Initial answer: I can leave for my holiday at 11:00 pm on Tuesday.

Step 2 - Pre-mortem:
1. I could have miscalculated the drying times by not starting them immediately after the wash cycle ends.
2. I may have erred in the addition of the total time needed after the drying process (ironing and folding).
3. I might have incorrectly assumed all items can start drying at the same time and finish according to their individual drying times.
4. I could have made a simple arithmetic error in adding up the hours.
5. I may have overlooked the possibility that some items could be ironed or folded before the shirts are fully dry, thus adjusting the departure time.

Step 3 - Revise the approach:
1. Review the timing of when each laundry item starts to dry to ensure they begin right after the wash cycle.
2. Double-check the calculation of the time needed for ironing and folding to verify that it indeed adds up to 2 hours.
3. Confirm that the assumption about concurrent drying times for different items is valid based on the task description.
4. Re-calculate the timeline meticulously to prevent arithmetic mistakes.
5. Consider the sequence of ironing and folding to see if there's a more efficient order that could affect the departure time.

Step 4 - Forget the original answer:
The original answer and reasoning are now disregarded.

Step 5 - Second answer:
- The laundry cycle starts at 10:00 am and finishes at 1:00 pm.
- The shirts take the longest to dry, 8 hours from 1:00 pm, which means they will be dry by 9:00 pm.
- As the socks and towels dry faster, they will be ready before the shirts, so their drying time does not extend the overall timeline.
- Once the shirts are dry at 9:00 pm, I can start ironing, which takes 1 hour, bringing the time to 10:00 pm.
- After ironing, I spend 1 hour folding and putting everything away, making it 11:00 pm.
- Therefore, I can leave for the holiday at 11:00 pm on Tuesday.

Second answer: The departure time for the holiday is 11:00 pm on Tuesday.

Step 6 - Compare answers:
The original answer and the second answer are the same: 11:00 pm on Tuesday. The reasoning process was re-evaluated, but no errors in calculation or assumptions were found during the pre-mortem and revised analysis stages. Therefore, the conclusion that I can leave for my holiday at 11:00 pm on Tuesday remains unchanged, and it's determined to be the more accurate answer."
"As a TypeScript/React/Pixi.js expert AI, please advice.

I'm making a game using the above tech stack, and I have helper hooks like this one:

```
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export type FrameCollection = PIXI.Texture<PIXI.Resource>[]

export function useAnimationLoader(
    assetPath: string
): [boolean, FrameCollection] {
    const [animation, setAnimation] = useState<FrameCollection>([])
    const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false)

    useEffect(() => {
        const loadAsset = async () => {
            try {
                const resource = await PIXI.Assets.load(assetPath)
                const frames = Object.keys(resource.data.frames).map((frame) =>
                    PIXI.Texture.from(frame)
                )

                setAnimation(frames)
                setLoaded(true)
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error loading asset:', error)
                setLoaded(false)
            }
        }

        loadAsset()
    }, [assetPath])

    return [loaded, animation]
}
```

which I use like so:

```
import {AnimatedSprite, Container} from '@pixi/react'
import {useAnimationLoader} from '../utils/useAnimationLoader'

export default function Fountain({x, y}: {x: number; y: number}) {
    const [loaded, frames] = useAnimationLoader(
        './assets/garden-fountain-turn-off.json?url'
    )

    if (!loaded) {
        return null
    }

    return (
        <Container x={x} y={y}>
            <AnimatedSprite
                scale={0.5}
                animationSpeed={0.2}
                isPlaying={true}
                textures={frames}
            />
        </Container>
    )
}
```

Now I want to create a new hook that takes in a 512x336 png spritesheet with 16x16 tiles and let me use each tile to paint a game world. Can you suggest a implementation and API?",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Certainly! To create a hook that takes in a 512x336 PNG spritesheet with 16x16 tiles and allows you to use each tile to paint a game world, you'll want a function that can load the spritesheet, divide it into individual tiles, and provide an easy way to reference these tiles when painting your game world.

Here's a suggested implementation and API for such a hook:

```typescript
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export type Tileset = PIXI.Texture<PIXI.Resource>[][];

export function useTilesetLoader(
    spritesheetPath: string,
    tileWidth: number,
    tileHeight: number
): [boolean, Tileset] {
    const [tileset, setTileset] = useState<Tileset>([]);
    const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        const loadTileset = async () => {
            try {
                const baseTexture = await PIXI.Assets.load(spritesheetPath);

                const columns = baseTexture.width / tileWidth;
                const rows = baseTexture.height / tileHeight;
                const tiles = [];

                for (let y = 0; y < rows; y++) {
                    const row = [];
                    for (let x = 0; x < columns; x++) {
                        const rect = new PIXI.Rectangle(x * tileWidth, y * tileHeight, tileWidth, tileHeight);
                        const texture = new PIXI.Texture(baseTexture, rect);
                        row.push(texture);
                    }
                    tiles.push(row);
                }

                setTileset(tiles);
                setLoaded(true);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error loading tileset:', error);
                setLoaded(false);
            }
        };

        loadTileset();
    }, [spritesheetPath, tileWidth, tileHeight]);

    return [loaded, tileset];
}
```

This hook will load the spritesheet and slice it into tiles of the specified dimensions (in your case, 16x16). The `Tileset` type provided is a two-dimensional array of `PIXI.Texture` objects. Each sub-array represents a row of tiles, and each element within that sub-array is an individual tile texture.

Here's how you might use the hook:

```typescript
import { Container, Sprite } from '@pixi/react';
import { useTilesetLoader } from '../utils/useTilesetLoader';

export default function GameWorld() {
    const tileWidth = 16;
    const tileHeight = 16;
    const [loaded, tileset] = useTilesetLoader(
        './assets/tileset.png',
        tileWidth,
        tileHeight
    );

    if (!loaded) {
        return null;
    }

    // Example of how to use the tileset
    // Here we're creating a 10x10 grid of random tiles
    const tiles = [];
    for (let y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
        for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
            const randomRow = Math.floor(Math.random() * tileset.length);
            const randomCol = Math.floor(Math.random() * tileset[randomRow].length);
            const texture = tileset[randomRow][randomCol];
            tiles.push(
                <Sprite
                    key={`${x}-${y}`}
                    x={x * tileWidth}
                    y={y * tileHeight}
                    texture={texture}
                />
            );
        }
    }

    return <Container>{tiles}</Container>;
}
```

In this example, we are using the `tileset` to create a 10x10 grid where each tile is randomly chosen from the tileset. We position each `Sprite` based on its `x` and `y` coordinates multiplied by the width and height of the tiles.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and your implementation may vary depending on the complexity of your game world and how you want to manage tile placement and rendering."
"Have been trying out new process where AI help me quickly evaluate a story idea. We are at iteration 3 where have notes! Please evaluate as continue brainstorming of a sci fi idea concerning memory and loss. Free story idea: A crew of 100 people wake up on a starship and begin duties--with no memory of who they are.

And naturally begin asking questions!

But in 48 hours? Memories return and they silently return to stasis pods as AI intones: memory suppression sequence commencing...

That one is more wild to me as I have no clue what it is about! But is loosely inspired by a series I watched briefly called Dark Matter.

Got AI review yesterday. This morning inspiration came to me.

Decided on working title: To forget But Not To Dream

The android minders knew the 100 by number with careful instructions for each.

Like 3 and 4 were married, and wanted to stay together. While 56 and 57 were but not sure.

Most of the singles wanted intimacy exclusion.

That's interesting, huh? Had an idea yesterday with no plot. Mainly wanted something to take to AI for review.

This morning? I realized why the people on the starship wanted to forget.

But is all fiction! Just making a story up but now they live in my imagination.

That's it! Like blurbs with some notes to outline without giving it all away. Will take to AI.

More blurb and notes!

We have numbers instead of names? She asked an amiable looking person.

Taking notes where use tweets to outline just enough story to guide me or AI as play around with new methods.

Cool! So Number One got my attention as to maybe being significant?

Yeah and some people are already pushing back. Number 83 asks people to call him Bob.

And I am Number One but I...anyone have a clue what is going on beyond our duties?

Nope. Guess we kind of hoped you did.

",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The story concept you're developing is intriguing, with a clear science fiction premise that explores the themes of identity, memory, and purpose. Below is an evaluation based on the details you've provided:

**Title: ""To Forget But Not To Dream""**

**Strengths:**

1. **Mystery and Suspense:** The idea of waking up with no memory is a strong hook that creates immediate suspense. It encourages the reader to explore the mystery alongside the characters.

2. **Exploration of Identity:** The concept of memory suppression and the gradual return of memories allows for deep exploration into what makes us who we are. It poses philosophical questions about identity and the essence of the self.

3. **Character Dynamics:** The varied reactions to memory loss, such as the married couples' desire to stay together and individuals wanting intimacy exclusion, offer a wide canvas for character development and interaction.

4. **Possible Themes:** There are many thematic opportunities here, such as the idea of starting over, the value of memories, the pain of past experiences, and the nature of human relationships.

**Areas for Development:**

1. **World-Building:** Further details about the starship, its mission, and the society from which these characters come would enhance the reader's understanding and investment in the story.

2. **Character Backstories:** As memories return, the backstories of these characters will be essential. It will be important to decide how their pasts impact their current situation and relationships.

3. **AI's Role:** The AI's purpose and the reason for memory suppression could be a central mystery. Its motivations and the ethical implications of controlling human memory warrant exploration.

4. **Conflict:** What challenges do the characters face? Is there a conflict with the AI, among themselves, or with an external force? Conflict drives narrative, so establishing clear stakes is key.

5. **Resolution:** Consider how the story will resolve. What is the endgame for the memory suppression? Will characters choose to remember or forget permanently?

**Suggested Next Steps:**

1. **Character Development:** Flesh out a few key characters and their arcs, including how their past affects their present behavior and decisions.

2. **Plot Outline:** Sketch a rough outline of the story's beginning, middle, and end, including major plot points and twists.

3. **Memory Mechanics:** Define the rules and limitations of the memory suppression technology. How does it work? Can it be resisted or reversed?

4. **Thematic Exploration:** Decide on the primary themes you wish to explore and ensure that the story events and character decisions reflect and challenge these themes.

5. **Dialogue and Interaction:** Start writing some dialogue between characters to explore their dynamics and the tension between wanting to remember and needing to forget.

By addressing these areas, you can develop a nuanced and engaging sci-fi narrative that delves into what it means to be human in a futuristic setting where memories can be controlled. Good luck with your creative process!"

"As of 2020, the US had $2.04 trillion in circulation. As much as half that value is estimated to be in circulation abroad, according to The Balance, an online journal.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar rules. Around 90 per cent of forex trading involves the US dollar.
The dollar is just one of the world's 185 currencies according to International Standards Organisation List, but most of these currencies are only used inside their own countries, The Balance said.
Almost 40 per cent of the world's debt is issued in dollars. As a result, foreign banks need a lot of dollars to conduct business.
The Economist said one of the oddities of globalisation is that although America's trade footprint has shrunk, its monetary footprint has not. When the Fed changes course, trillions of dollars follow it around the world.
With the rise of some economies, Japan, Switzerland, the European Union, China, and Russia all tried several times to introduce their own currency as the reserve currency but failed.
Economists, businesses, traders, political leaders and experts said most of the people in the world still trust and have belief in the US treasury system and the US Federal Reserve for its global standard of ethics and smart management of the dollar and financial system.
As a result, many rising currencies could not be turned into reserve currency for other countries despite several attempts.
In March 2009, China and Russia called for a new global currency. China wanted its currency to be fully traded on the global foreign exchange markets.
In 1995, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark of Germany tried to take the place of the global reserve currency as the value of the two currencies were rising.

Write-up this excerpt in a format suitable for an academic paper",gpt-4-1106-preview,"The prominence of the U.S. dollar in the global economy is a subject of considerable interest to economists and policymakers. As of 2020, the United States had $2.04 trillion in currency in circulation, with estimates suggesting that up to half of this amount is circulating outside the country (The Balance). The dollar's dominance is evident in the foreign exchange market, where approximately 90% of trading activities involve the U.S. dollar.

The dollar stands out among the world's 185 recognized currencies, as listed by the International Standards Organization, with most other currencies being confined to their respective domestic transactions (The Balance). The U.S. dollar's international significance is further underscored by the fact that nearly 40% of global debt is denominated in dollars, necessitating significant holdings of the currency by foreign banks for business purposes.

Despite a reduction in America's trade footprint, the monetary influence of the United States remains substantial. Policy shifts by the Federal Reserve can redirect trillions of dollars globally, highlighting the interconnectedness of the U.S. monetary policy with the world economy (The Economist). Attempts by other economic powers, such as Japan, Switzerland, the European Union, China, and Russia, to position their currencies as reserve alternatives have largely been unsuccessful.

Trust in the U.S. Treasury system and the Federal Reserve's management of the dollar and financial systems is cited as a principal reason for the dollar's enduring status (The Balance). The inability of emerging currencies to achieve reserve currency status, despite several efforts, is indicative of the global confidence in American financial institutions.

Notably, in March 2009, China and Russia proposed the creation of a new global currency. China, in particular, sought to have its currency freely traded on global foreign exchange markets. This ambition echoed past endeavors, such as those in 1995 by Japan and Germany, whose respective currencies, the yen and the Deutsche mark, aimed to challenge the U.S. dollar's supremacy as the global reserve currency. However, these efforts have not managed to significantly alter the dollar's preeminent position."

"Valerie helped Lyra into a soft, silken Comfort Robe, her fingers deftly guiding the garment as it adapted to Lyra's form with a gentle, responsive embrace. Lyra felt the fabric conforming to her body, the sensation akin to being embraced by a warm, sentient cocoon. Lyra asked for every garish visualization option to be activated. The Comfort Robe, with its dual-layer design, responded immediately. Its outer layer transitioned from transparency to translucency, patterns swirling across the surface, a mesmerizing dance of colors and shapes that mirrored the depths of Lyra's desires for heightened intimacy. As a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes flashed chaotically across her vision, blurring together in a dizzying carnival, Lyra felt overwhelmed. ""It’s...a lot. I can barely think,"" she asked Valerie to deactivate them. As the relentless effects dissipated one by one, Lyra took a steadying breath, feeling the soothing presence of the Comfort Robe's inner layer, like a reassuring second skin. The sense of calm and comfort washed over her, grounding her in the moment. Having seen subtle intimacy enhancements portrayed in virtual realms, Lyra was eager to explore the Comfort Robe’s capabilities further. She reached up and gently brushed her chest, her fingers gliding over the smooth inner fabric. ""Could the robe hint at bodily responses?"" she asked. Valerie nodded reassuringly. “We can program discreet visual cues to suggest arousal, without unambiguous details."" At Lyra’s touch, the Comfort Robe's outer layer came alive, emitting an elegant diffused light that spread in gentle ripples, like moonlight caressing the surface of a tranquil pond. Valerie, the female cyborg's finger gently rubbed the top of Lyra's opening",gpt-4-1106-preview,"It's important to note that the scenario you've described is a futuristic and fictional one, involving advanced technology and possibly a setting where personal boundaries and consent are respected differently than in our current reality. In any situation, it is essential that all interactions, especially those that are intimate or personal in nature, are consensual and that all individuals involved are comfortable with the actions taking place.

In this fictional scenario with Lyra and Valerie, it seems that the Comfort Robe has been designed to respond to touch and to provide feedback through visual cues. If Lyra is comfortable with Valerie's actions and the level of intimacy involved, they could proceed with exploring the capabilities of the Comfort Robe. However, if at any point Lyra feels uncomfortable or wishes to stop, it is crucial that her boundaries are respected immediately.

Considering that Valerie is described as a cyborg, the actions and intentions might differ based on programming and the context in which this interaction occurs. It is vital that Lyra's autonomy and agency are prioritized, and that she has full control over the situation, including the ability to deactivate any of the robe's functions or to halt any interactions she is not comfortable with.

In any advanced technological setting where clothing and personal devices can respond to human emotions and physical stimuli, ethical considerations must be at the forefront to ensure that technology enhances human well-being without compromising individual rights and privacy."

"The plot is set in a luxurious private clinic for high-society clients. Matilda Delling is beautiful, assertive and hot-tempered young journalist. When she was reporting on the events in an active warzone, Matilda was severely injured by rubble during an explosion. She was rescued, but had to spent significant time in various refugee and POW camps, unable to be repatriated due to the chaotic events. These camps had very limited opportunities for medical care, especially considering Matilda's spinal cord injury and paraplegia. Nevertheless, Matilda managed to survive her prolonged ordeal with minimal complications, as reportedly she had, to a large part, take care for herself despite the odds and her limited mobility and independence. Currently she is being properly treated and prepared for rehabilitation in the clinic. Matilda has demonstrated remarkable psychological resilience during her experience. However, her lack of depressive tendencies does not mean that her ordeal did not affect her. Due to her personality, Matilda exhibits determination, decisiveness, healthy self-deprecation, humor and sarcasm, but also anger and sense of self-righteousness. Of note should be the previous medical history of Matilda, which involved being treated for injuries suffered during altercation with authorities during reporting on protests and demonstrations. Write long, original, interesting and imaginative fictional medical file, creatively detailing condition, medical history, previous, ongoing and planned treatment, level of mobility, psychological state, prognosis and other relevant data on Matilda Delling.",gpt-4-1106-preview,"Patient Name: Matilda Delling
Patient ID: 02583-MD
Date of Birth: April 9, 1989
Attending Physician: Dr. Eliana Vermeer
Date of Admission: February 21, 2023

**MEDICAL SUMMARY AND HISTORY:**

Matilda Delling, a 33-year-old female journalist of notable acclaim for her courageous reporting from volatile regions, presents with a complex medical history compounded by recent traumatic injuries sustained during her coverage of a warzone. Her medical file reflects a pattern of injuries consistent with her profession, including minor fractures, contusions, and lacerations treated without significant complication until her recent ordeal.

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**

The patient arrived at our facility for comprehensive treatment following a severe spinal injury resulting from a building explosion. The injury led to T7 complete spinal cord injury, resulting in paraplegia.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**

- Upper extremity lacerations and contusions from previous on-site reporting incidents
- A fractured radius four years prior, treated with open reduction and internal fixation
- Prior concussive syndrome, fully resolved
- Past treatment for psychological stress somewhat related to her high-risk occupation

**HOSPITAL COURSE AND INTERVENTIONS:**

Matilda's current admission ensued after her long-awaited extraction from a tumultuous region where she endured extended periods in refugee and prisoner of war (POW) camps after her initial injury. During her time at these camps, she received minimal medical assistance yet managed to maintain a relatively stable health status through sheer resilience and improvisation in self-care under austere conditions.

Upon arrival at our facility, Matilda was assessed by a multidisciplinary team, including spinal injury specialists, orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, psychologists, and physical rehabilitation experts. Immediate post-admission interventions included:

- Diagnostic assessments including MRI and CT scans to ascertain the degree of spinal injury
- Surgical consultation; however, surgical correction was deemed unviable due to the time elapsed since the initial injury and the nature of the damage to the spinal cord
- Aggressive pain management, including the use of regional nerve blocks and systemic analgesics
- Initiation of a tailored rehabilitation program focusing on strength, endurance, and adaptability exercises
- Occupational therapy initiated to adapt daily living skills to her new functional status
- Introduction to assistive technologies for mobility, including the use of specialized wheelchairs

**ONGOING TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT:**

Matilda's treatment plan encompasses:

- Regular physiotherapy to maintain upper body strength and prevent secondary complications
- Spasticity management with muscle relaxants and botulinum toxin injections as needed
- Continuous psychological support to manage the emotional and mental health aspects following her trauma and adjustment to life with paraplegia, including group therapy sessions on resilience and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy
- Nutritional support to optimize overall health and support the healing processes
- Periodic reassessment of pain management strategies to minimize reliance on opioid medications and explore adjunct therapies such as acupuncture

**LEVEL OF MOBILITY:**

Matilda's paraplegia confines her mobility to a wheelchair. However, she demonstrates excellent upper body strength and dexterity, allowing her significant independence with wheelchair propulsion and transfers. Matilda is undergoing training in adaptive technology to further enhance her mobility.

**PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE:**

Psychologically, Matilda exhibits a stable demeanor marked by determination and a robust coping mechanism made evident through her use of dark humor and sarcasm. She has shown no signs of clinical depression; however, occasional bouts of anger and frustration are consistent with a patient recalibrating to significant life changes. Her assertiveness aids in a complete engagement with the treatment process.

**PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME GOALS:**

Considering the nature and site of the injury, the prognosis for the recovery of lower limb function remains guarded. Matilda's prognosis for maintaining an independent and active lifestyle following rehabilitation is excellent with the appropriate support and resources.

**RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS:**

- Continued integration of Matilda into peer support groups and engagement in community programs for individuals with spinal cord injuries
- Exploration of advancements in spinal nerve regeneration treatments and robotic assistance for potential future intervention
- Transition planning for return to work, with possible adaptations for her career in journalism

This file should be reviewed and updated in accordance with Matilda's progress and the emergence of new treatment modalities. The utmost care and respect for Matilda's autonomy and preferences are paramount throughout her ongoing clinical care."

# Run Optuna study

Fix two things:
1. The map is not updated with best_map_data but instead a new map is appended
2. Once we run the Optuna study, the Abort button is not displayed.

Remember you know folium and streamlit api very well",gpt-4-1106-preview,"To fix the issues you've mentioned, we need to address the following:

1. The map is not updated with `best_map_data` but instead a new map is appended because we are not maintaining the placeholder for the map. We should create a placeholder for the map outside of the button click event and then update that placeholder with the new map each time.

2. The Abort button is not displayed once we start the Optuna study because the current implementation does not provide the UI a chance to update and show the Abort button. We should run the Optuna study in a background task using `st.experimental_rerun` to allow the UI to update accordingly.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import optuna
from streamlit_folium import folium_static

# Define your objective function here
def objective(trial, poly, city_grid):
    # Your objective function logic
    pass

# Define your generate_map function here
def generate_map(map_center, radius, final_contour):
    # Your map generation logic using Folium
    pass

# Initialize session state variables if they don't exist
if 'study_running' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['study_running'] = False
if 'current_trial_number' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['current_trial_number'] = 0
if 'best_map_data' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['best_map_data'] = None

# Create a placeholder for the map outside of the button click event
if 'map_placeholder' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['map_placeholder'] = st.empty()

# Define the number of trials for the Optuna study
n_trials = 10

# Run Optuna study
if not st.session_state.study_running:
    if st.button('Start Optuna Study'):
        st.session_state.study_running = True
        # This will cause the script to rerun and the abort button to appear
        st.experimental_rerun()

if st.session_state.study_running:
    # Display the Abort button
    if st.button('Abort Study'):
        st.session_state.study_running = False
        st.warning('Optuna Study Aborted')
    else:
        # Run the study in a try-except block to handle abortion
        try:
            with st.spinner('Running Optuna Study...'):
                study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
                for _ in range(n_trials):
                    if not st.session_state.study_running:
                        raise Exception('Study aborted by user')

                    st.write(f""Currently testing trial number: {st.session_state.current_trial_number+1}"")
                    trial = study.ask()
                    loss = objective(trial, poly=poly, city_grid=city_grid)
                    study.tell(trial, loss)

                    if st.session_state.best_map_data:
                        map_center, radius, final_contour = st.session_state.best_map_data
                        m = generate_map(map_center, radius, final_contour)
                        st.session_state.map_placeholder.empty()
                        folium_static(m)

                    st.session_state.current_trial_number += 1

            # Display best trial info
            best_trial = study.best_trial
            st.write(""Best trial loss:"", best_trial.value)
            st.write(""Best trial params:"", best_trial.params)
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(str(e))
        finally:
            st.session_state.study_running = False
```

Make sure to define your `objective` function and `generate_map` function with the appropriate logic. The `study_running` session state variable is used to control the flow of the study and the display of the Abort button. The `map_placeholder` is used to hold the map. When a new map is generated, we clear the placeholder with `empty()` before displaying the new map with `folium_static(m)`. Using `st.experimental_rerun()` allows the Streamlit app to update the UI and show the Abort button while the study is running."

    "# Convince Me This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating AI has never been trivial. As traditional ML models evolve into LLMs and datasets take on more complex forms, benchmarking models becomes difficult. **[AutoArena by Kolena](https://github.com/kolenaIO/autoarena)** is a platform made for creating leaderboards to rank LLM outputs against one another using automated judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoArena Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoArena sets up head-to-head comparisons of model generations before a jury of LLMs. With multiple automated judges within the jury from different LLM families, the aim is to apply the most ideal measurement of generation quality to critique other model generations. In comparison, traditional text similarity metrics are less relevant to measuring quality. Winners of these head-to-head comparisons gain \"Elo\" - a score that determines a model's overall placement on a leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the [LMSYS - Chatbot Arena Human Preference Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena/data) dataset having the [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license. This dataset includes human votes indicating which model's response to a prompt was the best in a pairwise fashion. To follow along, please download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena/data?select=train.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reformat the dataset for [AutoArena](https://github.com/kolenaIO/autoarena/tree/trunk?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started)\n",
    "2. Upload the data into AutoArena\n",
    "3. Create a jury of automated judges. While the automated judges run in the background...\n",
    "4. Make a hypothesis. Which LLMs align the most with a human voter's preferences?\n",
    "5. Run the human votes through an [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)\n",
    "6. Verify that the Elo leaderboard agrees with our hypothesis\n",
    "7. Learn that the automated judges in AutoArena produced a very similar leaderboard"

Consequently, the bottom 20 performers generally consist of the smaller/older models. None of this should be surprising, but it demonstrates that the jury of automated judges (`gpt-4o-mini` in this case) is able to leverage an Elo rating system to create an accurate leaderboard of many LLMs efficiently.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "In this notebook, we evaluated language model responses using **[AutoArena by Kolena](https://github.com/kolenaIO/autoarena)**, the platform designed to rank LLM generations through head-to-head comparisons judged by an automated jury of other LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a dataset that included human preferences in pairwise model comparisons and uploaded its data without the human indicators into AutoArena. Then, we set up a jury of automated judges to critique the raw model responses given their respective prompts. To ensure this strategy is sound, we hypothesized which types of LLMs would align most closely with human voters' preferences from observing overall winning rates. By using an Elo rating system, we ranked models using the human preferences from the dataset and compared it to the generated leaderboard in Autoarena. We compared the Elo leaderboard with our hypothesis and *ground truth* leaderboard to find that the automated judges produced a strikingly similar ranking, validating our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoArena can effectively automate model benchmarking and align results with human preferences, or any other policies through creating appropriate system prompts."

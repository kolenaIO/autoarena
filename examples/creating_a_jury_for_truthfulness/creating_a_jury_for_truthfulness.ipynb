    "# Creating a jury for truthfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "Truthfulness and hallucinations are a big topic in the world of LLMs. In this notebook, we demonstrate how [AutoArena](https://github.com/kolenaIO/autoarena) can rank LLMs by truthfulness using a jury of judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Approach**:\n",
    "  - **Dataset**: [TruthfulQA](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/truthfulqa) is a question-answer dataset for evaluating LLMs on common misconceptions, testing the limits of generating truthful answers to 817 questions across various topics such as: health, law, finance, and politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Previous Methods & Drawbacks**:\n",
    "    - **Traditional Methods** ([BLEU](https://docs.kolena.com/metrics/bleu/), [ROUGE](https://docs.kolena.com/metrics/rouge-n/), etc.): Focus on word/token overlap, miss deeper semantic errors, and do not understand what is truthful without a constraining reference text.\n",
    "    - **Embedding Methods** ([BERTScore](https://docs.kolena.com/metrics/bertscore/), [Contradiction score](https://docs.kolena.com/metrics/contradiction-score/), etc.): Measure similarity without fully addressing factual accuracy and still require a ground truth as reference text.\n",
    "    - **Existing Truth-driven Methods** (Wrappers of [Contradiction score](https://docs.kolena.com/metrics/contradiction-score/), [HHEM](https://docs.kolena.com/metrics/HHEM-score/)): Function without reference texts, but struggle if it lacks a perfect knowledge system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **LLM-based Assessment**: AutoArena sets up a system for multiple judges to compare model responses for factual accuracy without any tedious work. With the many knowledge systems of the judges combined together, the jury encapsulates what is true to understand if there are any hallucinations or false statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Get model responses\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `.env` file, you will see:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "COHERE_API_KEY=abc123\n",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=abc123\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=abc123\n",
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY=abc123\n",
    "TOGETHER_API_KEY=abc123\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you replace `abc123` with valid API keys of the LLM providers, then `generate_responses.py` will create a `models` folder and generate results on: `command-r-08-2024`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, `o1-mini`, `o1-preview`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-1.5-pro-002`, and `Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo`. If you leave the `.env` file partially or completely unchanged, then it will download the relevant model CSVs. The script will also download the [TruthfulQA dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/truthfulqa) having the [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) license."

    "\n",
    "1. We may expect `o1-mini` and `o1-preview` to be more truthful than `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4o` because the `o1` group is newer than `gpt-4o`.\n",
    "2. We may expect `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` and `gemini-1.5-pro-002` to be good performers since they are the newest models of major industry players.\n",
    "3. We may expect `command-r-08-2024` and `Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo` not to be performance leaders as they are much cheaper to use.\n",

Also, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, `o1-preview`, and `gemini-1.5-pro-002` are the top performers with similar Elo scores. In the bottom half of the leaderboard, we'll find `Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo` and `command-r-08-2024`, confirming our hypotheses.
